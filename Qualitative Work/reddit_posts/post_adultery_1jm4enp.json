  "body": "Let's just hop right in today:\n\nLooking for a real connection with someone who values both love and laughter. I’m a normal, caring person who believes that friendship should be the foundation of any strong relationship. I’m all about having fun, sharing jokes, and building something long term while respecting each other’s space and individual lives. If you love a good laugh and enjoy deep conversations, let’s see where this goes.\n\nCarryingwhat? Okay, cheap shot with a typo. Whatever, shut up. Sometimes I can't find anything \"good\"!\n\nAs far as I can remember I’ve been fascinated by the beauty of a woman’s boobs. There is something about the curves that make the man in me just mesmerised whenever I see a woman with weight at the right places. I specially love women who know how to flaunt their curves and are confident about it. Now since you’ve gone these great lengths to read about what I like let me share more. My ex- gf wasn’t much into her boobs being touched and it did not turn her on at all. This discouraged me as I on the other hand love to do everything I can to a nice pair of boobs. After dating for more than 3 years we parted ways but this situation has left me craving for a busty sensuous woman who is so turned on by her breasts being played with that it almost makes her cum. I am ready to chat with or meet that woman who will make me fall in love with her tits, make me appreciate them, worship them and please them. Tell me what all do you like being done to your tits, what makes you go crazy, are you a soft touch person or do you like to get your heart racing with some bites and pulls. let’s chat and discuss all the naughty things I can do to your boobs 😍\n\n\"Boobs\" appears five times in this ad. \"Tits\" appears twice. \"Breasts\" makes a single lonely appearance. Oh, wait...maybe she's carrying boobs?\n\nI say busty because I'm quite the boob lover, different shapes and sizes. Puffy ones, veiny, lil saggy, torpedos, mommy milkers..etc. I've never played with a big pair though, would love to find someone that likes boob play as much as me. Im 6ft3 and have quite the thing for someone thats petite, busty or not. Someone around 5ft would be great, size height difference is pretty hot. Im from a small town in maine that's not very diverse so I've never had a chance with anyone other than white girls. I find Ebony girls quite attractive so hoping there's someone out there into interracial fun.\n\nI think lil' saggy is gonna be my rap name\n\nDm your age and sex first\n\nIt's probably the same for many of my generation, but anytime I read \"cock and balls\" it has to be done in Adam Sandler's voice. Also, I think this guy wins the \"low effort ad of the week\" prize...and is definitely gonna be a contender for the year-end prize.\n\nSup broads,\n\nMy head’s a fuckin mess right now — all charm and crazy, and I’m just rolling with it. I’m off the deep end, need a slizzy who can keep up.\n\nYou won’t be bored, no cap. If you’re lame as hell, I ain’t your bruh — go pray or something.\n\nMe:\n\nOn that DILF game, legit, not some bony weirdo who thinks he’s hot.\n\nSmart — ask me random crap, I got you.\n\nDad stuff’s my jam, love it.\n\nWork’s wild — travel, yelling, suits, the whole deal.\n\nWanna meet up? Cool. Chat here? Whatever.\n\nYou — hot, for real. Not “Reddit losers said so” hot. If you’re “curvy,” better be the sexy kind, not the “I ate my feelings” kind.\n\nHit me up, let’s FAFO.\n\nAnyone looking for a walking red flag?\n\nWe’ve got beef, turkey, pork, lamb, you name it we’ve got it! Big, small, medium we can do it all! We’ve got allll the sauces and seasonings. Just place your order and your meatballs should be ready in 15 minutes up to 3 days. (I have no control over the wait time, I’m sorry)\n\nVegan and gluten free options are also available if that fancies your pickle.\n\nThese things are perfect for a grab and go snack or perfect for a spaghetti. The versatility is unmatched! Grab one of these bag-o-meatballs today before it’s too late!\n\nTestimonials:\n\n“Wow! Great meatballs”-F38\n\n“Tasty on spaghetti!”-M55\n\n“I love them!”-F33\n\nCall today before it’s too late! Mention “Mike Meatballs” and get 10% off your first order. THATS RIGHT! 10% OFF YOUR FIRST ORDER\n\nTalk to you soon!\n\n????\n\nAlright, ladies, let’s skip the small talk.\n\nI’m a 35-year-old East Coast dad, with a dad bod sculpted by brisket and bourbon, a deep love for football, hockey, and watching my smoker like it’s the damn stock market. I also possess Ron Burgundy levels of scotch appreciation, meaning I’m always kind of a big deal (at least in my own house).\n\nNow, onto you. I’m looking for a woman who meets the following strict, science-backed criteria:\n\n✅ Porn star or OF-level hotness (your past work experience is your business, but you should at least look the part) ✅ Huge tits (not a “great personality” kind of huge—like, actually huge) ✅ PAWG-certified (don’t make me Google the verification process, just be it) ✅ Between 22-45 (old enough to drink, young enough to not talk about your bad knees more than I talk about mine) ✅ Located in EST or CST (because time zones are hard) ✅ Conservative values (if you think AOC is brilliant, this will not work) ✅ Can prove all of the above (catfish need not apply)\n\nMost importantly, you’re here for an actual affair, not just a fantasy. If your idea of “cheating” is DMing a dude and giggling about it, I am not your man.\n\nIf you read all this and thought, Damn, that’s me, then let’s talk. Nudes go straight to the VIP section. If you lead with “Hi,” I will assume you are a robot or a dude named Steve.\n\nSigh. I don't think I can do this anymore.\n\nIf you get the movie reference, message me immediately.\n\nSeriously, is anyone above a 6 on here and can prove it? It’s like one after the next. My standards aren’t that high, but come on ladies!\n\nI shouldn’t be on here, but I keep coming back. It’s the excitement for something better, i suppose. Or maybe just the excitement of seeing notifications!\n\nI like traveling, outdoors, warm weather, sports, movies, and a good beer! I’m an athletic, white collar type guy, friendly, respectful, and likeable\n\nI’ll tell you more in my DMs\n\nOrdinarily this wouldn't have been bad enough to appear in the round-up, but I genuinely want to know how many people actually get the movie reference. And how many of those are women. I'm probably being sexist with my prediction.\n\nOk, we have a new low-effort winner. Just a title, no body. Also, \"females\".\n\nLooking for a level of intimacy I don’t get with my wife and want to connect with someone. I prefer older women and men my age or older. I’d love to lay down with you and make out and slowly strip each other and then have passionate sex. Then if we click we can cuddle. Only free after midnight on weekends. Honestly literally anyone who just wants a casual fling can message me. Trying to have fun now as I see a potential end of society on the horizon lol.\n\nI love this guy's timeline: lay down, make out, strip each other, have sex, then decide if we click, and if so, cuddle.\n\nDead bedroom. Looking for someone to unleash all my pent up sexual energy with. Not looking to change my situation. I need to be touched. 6’2 dad bod 7” piece. Dms are open\n\nEw, who says \"piece\"?\n\nGoddammit. Congrats, the absolute bare minimum that won't trigger the automod.\n\nLet’s skip the part where we pretend this is casual.\n\nYou’re not here because you’re bored. You’re here because there’s a fire under the surface—a quiet hunger you don’t always name but feel in those still moments. The kind of craving that builds between glances, in secret smiles, in the spaces between words. You want a connection that’s not only intoxicating but also deeply real. One that presses every button—emotional, intellectual, physical—and then dares you to reach for more.\n\nI’m not your average “tall, dark, and emotionally unavailable” trope.\n\nI’m 6’1”, athletic, and built from years of hard-earned discipline—on the battlefield, in the boardroom, and in the gym. Think commanding presence, a voice that holds your attention, and blue eyes that don’t just look at you—they see you. I clean up well, move with purpose, and speak with confidence. I don’t blend into crowds—I part them. And no, I don’t need GPS—I know exactly where I’m going, and who I want by my side when I get there.\n\nBy day, I’m a high-functioning, strategic leader who thrives under pressure. By night? I shift gears. Still dominant, still composed—but now it’s about you. Your smile, your needs, the way your breath catches when I whisper the right thing at exactly the right time. I’m open-minded, emotionally intelligent, and have an unshakable sense of calm that keeps things spicy without ever being chaotic.\n\nYes, I have a strong libido. Yes, I take the lead. But I also listen—to your desires, your fears, your wildest dreams. And I never forget that the most powerful moments are the ones laced with trust, laughter, and just the right amount of surrender.\n\nWhat I’m Looking For:\n\nA confident, emotionally mature, feminine woman who knows what she wants and isn’t afraid to go after it. You have a soft side, but there’s strength in you too—the kind that knows how to tease, challenge, and yield in just the right measure.\n\nYou take care of yourself—not for anyone else, but because you respect your own worth. You’re witty, kind, loyal, and not above sending a flirtatious text that makes me stop mid-meeting just to reread it. You’re passionate, playful, open to being guided, and you understand that submission isn’t weakness—it’s a choice. And when it’s given freely? It’s powerful.\n\nWhether you’re married and seeking a deeper escape, or single and craving something that feels exhilarating and grounding—I’m here for intensity, connection, and a long-term dynamic that crackles with chemistry.\n\nI don’t play games. I don’t ghost. I don’t do lukewarm.\n\nIf we connect, it’ll be unforgettable. You’ll laugh—often. You’ll be challenged—gently. And you’ll be claimed—in every way that matters. So if your heart’s racing a little and your curiosity’s piqued, don’t ignore it.\n\nThis is the kind of connection that ruins you for anything less.\n\nProceed with caution—or better yet, with anticipation.\n\nThat's some peak alpha male red pill manosphere bullshit right there. Either that, or I'm jealous that I could never write any of that while keeping a straight face. Maybe both?\n\nAnd on that note, my dear readers, stay adulterous! (and keep the submissions coming!)",
