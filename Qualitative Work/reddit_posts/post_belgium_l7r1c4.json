  "body": "Hey guys! I've been struggling with this for almost a week now and Google Support hasn't helped at all. Basically I need to verify my age using my credit card or ID to watch certain videos on YouTube. I've also read that if this doesn't happen I might lose access to my account completely. Now on the support pages it tells me that I cannot send my National ID card, and since I don't have drivers license (and only a prepaid credit cards which also isn't accepted) I'm now stuck. I wonder if anyone else has tried this but then successfully, and how did you do it?\n\nI've been talking to Google support a few times, but they just can't/won't help me. I really hope I don't lose access to the account as it's my main account.",
