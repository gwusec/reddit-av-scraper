  "body": "If ethically sourced and used responsibly by adults I‚Äôm in support of freedom to publish erotic imagery on the web.\n\nAnyway, I noticed recently that at least two of the very biggest and most well known sites now direct you to an explanation that because Indiana requires age verification before you access their site, the complexities involved have pushed them to decide to simply be unavailable in Indiana. That‚Äôs it.\n\nI support making it difficult for underage web users to consume pornography when they are far too young and impressionable to do so. But this feels weird - like responsible adults‚Äô internet usage is essentially being censored by the state. Anyone else notice this? Thoughts or opinions?",

So they \"banned\" porn but they did it so badly that it just forces users to visit their unbanned competition and also use less reputable sites. And all of this can be circumvented with a VPN or a  dozen other simple tricks. Our lawmakers spent our money on this dumb shit!"
