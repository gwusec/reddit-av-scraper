  "body": "Hellooo.. so I've been on roblox for ages now and ive had voice chat until recently. Ive also been able to buy robux until recently. It seems like there was an update that messed up my account (or maybe I did it myself bahaha) that says I need to add a parent and that I cannot buy robux without a parent. It also seems to believe that I'm like... 13 or something when my age has already been verified. I've reached out to roblox support a couple of times already and everything they respond with just does not help me. When I reload my page it tells me that I need to fix my age but it immediately goes away and is just stuck saying \"verified\".... like please im literally an adult I don't want to add a parent account, and I'm a bit afraid to add one because I don't want it to mess up my account even more... any solutions?? it's happening on all of my platforms. just disappointing because this is the first big issue ive experienced on Roblox in my 11 years of being on the platform....",

      "body": "honestly, you can try to contact roblox support (even tho i highly doubt it works), if it does work then they might ask you to verify again. also about the last thing i doubt it will make it worse, you can add your own email or account (something like that). hope these options atleast helped you but i kinda doubt it"
