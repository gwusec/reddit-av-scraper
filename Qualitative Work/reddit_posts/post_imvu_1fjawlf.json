  "body": "just wanted to share my experience with getting my birthdate changed on imvu. i know a lot of people are nervous to correct their ages once they turn 18 due to them making their accounts when they were a minor (i'm also guilty, made my account when i was 16), so i hope this encourages more people to go through the process of getting age verified if they wish without the fear of getting their account banned. i've seen a lot of people say that trying to correct their age is a ban-able offense, and maybe that was true in the past, but for me this was so easy and quick and support didn't pry or ask unnecessary questions.\n\nyou WILL need to send a picture of your id or some form of government issued document as well as a selfie of your face. i saw on a lot of threads and related questions about this that there are people who aren't comfortable giving out their information like that but for the in-app verification process it is necessary unfortunately.\n\nanyways, i hope this helps anyone who has been avoiding opening a ticket about this, the process is much less intimidating than its made out to be",

      "body": "I'm trying to receive payments for offers I completed. One of the offers was levelling up in a game. I never received payment for level 15 but I did for level 20 and 30 and for some reason I'm being told I didn't complete the offer. Despite the fact that that doesn't physically make sense. The other offer said to complete a certain room, I took ss of the game where it even said completed. I have ss of emails from the game saying I either to contact imvu support or that I indeed completed the offer and again contact imvu support and I've shown them this and they're asking for my fyber id and now digital turbine id and when I ask what those are and how to get it for them, they ignore me. Just recently I got a response stating I didn't read the email correctly and I didn't complete the offer.. So reasonably I start highlighting parts of each ss, the level offer had 2 other payment task and literally say optional but for some reason they don't see that part. I highlight the part in the email where support from the other game tells me to contact imvu support and even the part where they say I completed the task. Being gaslighted again and again that I didn't complete the offer that I in fact very much completed is so strange to me"
