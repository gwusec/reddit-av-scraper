  "body": "I'm 14 so I should be able to play most games I want to but I have no sort of identification to submit. My favorite game got set to 13+ so even though I AM 13+ I can't play it because I don't have any identification I can send in. I don't have a passport, I don't have access to my birth certificate and my parents likely wouldn't understand why I'd need to submit a picture of my birth certificate to a video game anyways. I don't have a drivers license and I'm not going to be using my parents drivers licenses without their permission (and I know they wouldn't want me submitting a picture of their licenses to a game) so now I keep seeing all these cool games that I am legitimately old enough for but I don't have any way to prove it so I can't play them. Is there any way I can get around this????\n\nedit: nvm figured it out! my account is now able to play 13+ games, it's the 17+ games that you need the verification for.",
