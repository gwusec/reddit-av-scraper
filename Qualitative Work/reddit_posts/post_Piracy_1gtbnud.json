I think the channel's mental outlaw mentioned it and that's how I found it.You can get around the age restriction by having an account which is over 18 what's the big deal regarding it.When YouTube made a lot of game trailers age restricted, also Japanese music videos I started an account citing I was over 18.FDM used to be able to download youtube videos not so much anymore."
