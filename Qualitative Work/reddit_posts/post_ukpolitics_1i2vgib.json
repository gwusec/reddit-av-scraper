      "body": "Thereâ€™s a very specific, very technical way in which this could be implemented in a zero trust way.It is technically possible for some authority (the government, your bank, whoever) to issue a cryptographic certificate that would prove part of your identify/properties (e.g. this person is over 18).If done right then you can use that certificate to prove to (for example) Pornhub that youâ€™re over 18 without having to disclose anything else about your identity, and without having to tell the authority that you watch porn.If OfCom were setting up that infrastructure as part of this then it would be a huge positive. There are so many more significant problems that could be solved by that technology.Theyâ€™re not. Theyâ€™re just making it the responsibility of each individual website and so obviously itâ€™s going to be done in the cheapest and least secure way possible."
