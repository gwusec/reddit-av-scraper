  "body": "With the senate hearings this week and the increased awareness around children being negatively impacted by using social media it seems likely that a lot of services will start to ask you to confirm and even authenticate your age beyond simply typing in a birth date.\n\nI know a lot of us are uncomfortable with things like scanning a driver's license or sharing our credit card info.\n\nSo what would this community suggest as a way to be in compliance with such age restrictions without violating our privacy?",

I'm hoping there is a solution that works for everyone.I don't mind breaching terms of service when I access a service as a consumer, but what if I have to a access a service through my job? That would be too risky."

Age itself is an aspect of identity that cannot be verified without cross checking other identity bound information.You and a third party may be able to pick who gets to see your personal records to conduct a trusted two party verification (think OAuth-- sign in with google on non-google websites), but you're still going to have to reveal those details to someone thoroughly enough to be accepted as proof of age."
