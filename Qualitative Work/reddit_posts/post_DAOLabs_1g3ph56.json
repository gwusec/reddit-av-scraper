  "title": "AI to Revolutionize ID Verification!",
  "body": "I am a proponent of the Circular Economy Model, and this is at the root of why I support the promise of blockchain technologies. The age of the AI has barely begun, and it has already become apparent that this is an unstoppable change, unless we utterly shift the current trajectory of human development. Web3, with all the potential for decentralized, transparent, democratized access, needs blockchain technology to become reality. DePIN, DeFi, DeGEN, DeX... the list goes longer as we add powerhouses such as DeRWA and DeRE to its growing might. Both paradigm shifts require AI to properly bring to life this titanic reimagination of what it means to live free to make one's own decisions without some central controlling hand, to be human and that is where the third AI revolution comes to the fore.\n\nAutonomys Network is itself a reimagining of the older Subspace Protocol. Subspace is a novel consensus mechanism. Jeremiah Wagstaff created this technology expressly to replace traditional compute-heavy mining with a storage-based approach, using Proof-of-Archival-Storage (PoAS).\n\nThis protocol separates storage and computation. This separation then allows users to contribute storage capacity (\"farming\") while maintaining the blockchain's history.\n\nFarmer's Dilemma highlights a key challenge in storage-based consensusá…³farmers have to balance storing the chain's history against optimizing storage for rewards.\n\nProof-of-Archival-Storage (PoAS) consensus mechanism is the Autonomys answer. It allows nodes (farmers) to store history collectively. Unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS),\n\nPoAS creates long-term data availability and allows anyone with storage capacity to join. This in turn promotes a broader distribution of network resources.\n\nAutonomys also recognizes a key issue is that in the current system we do not actually have control of our identification, called the only true wealth in the Data Age. Their solution, Auto ID enables self-sovereign identity verification.\n\nThis is intended to give the control of our identity back to us, so we as users can prove that we are human while managing AI interactions without having to divulge biometric data. This system is particularly relevant in the age of AI, where controlling digital identity becomes crucial for human-AI interaction.\n\nWhile I am not afraid of the Big Brother watching me, I do believe Auto ID could provide a more secure and user-friendly alternative to existing identity verification systems. This system uses cryptographic proofs to prove authenticity but does it without centralized oversight, making it more private.\n\nThus we can leverage our identity across various platforms without repeatedly proving our credentials, making it hassle-free as well. As we well know, traditional identity systems often rely on centralized databases prone to breaches, while Auto ID's decentralized structure can mitigate that risk. Blockchain to the rescue, again!\n\nAuto Coin on the other hand is the medium of exchange within the Autonomys ecosystem. It is used in rewarding users who contribute storage to maintain the blockchain. Farmers earn Auto Coins based on the amount of storage they provide and their participation in the network's consensus process. This is an important measure to provide a more accessible entry point for users compared to computationally intensive protocols like proof-of-work\n\nThis shift from computation to storage reduces environmental impact, which is another tenet of the Circular Economy Model. Blockchain technologies as well as AI has been critisized for being energy hogs, and this is another step in the right direction to address this legitimate concern.",
