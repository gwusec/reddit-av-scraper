  "body": "Iowa SHOULD obviously follow Texas lead on porn websites verifying the age of its consumers.\n\nIn fact it‚Äôs disturbing that so many people fight for the right of minors to look at this explicit content.\n\nThere is NOT 1 good argument against it. ‚ÄúJust parent harder‚Äù might be the worst. I don‚Äôt see the  ‚Äújust parent harder‚Äù crowd complaining about age verification when it comes to alcohol, tobacco, gambling, tattoos, sex shops and adult only venues\n\nHell back in the day when they sold porn physically you had to be 18 to purchase.\n\nI‚Äôd like to hear one valid argument why in Gods name predatory porn sites that have a history themselves using minors IN porn, why they shouldn‚Äôt be forced to verify the age of the viewers.",

      "body": "The good answer is that mainstream sites like PornHub comply with laws to review for uploaded CP, or revenge porn takedown requests, and take them seriously.If you mandate user identification, persons who don't want the government to be able to match their porn preferences with their identities are going to go the less reputable sites.And anyone with a VPN can avoid the requirement entirely."

Your law is ineffective posturing, not a solution. That alone is enough reason to dump it."

It's really not that hard to prevent minors from looking at adult content, at least on your own devices. Kinda sounds like conservative parents want their strict morality shoved on to everyone else.\"There is NOT 1 good argument against it\"Sure there is: privacy. Stay the fuck out of my business and parent your goddamn kids better you lazy fuck."
