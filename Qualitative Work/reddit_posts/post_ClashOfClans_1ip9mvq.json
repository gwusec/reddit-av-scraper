The short answer is you cant change the age.I contacted supercell support and they said it would be not possible to change the age. So in the end they made a new supercell account for me with a new email i gave them and then i changed it back to the original email i was using. In your case i would do the same, if you have a secondary account, go to the in game support button and click lost account."
