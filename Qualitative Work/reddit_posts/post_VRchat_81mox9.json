  "body": "So I went on VRChat today, and much to my dismay, discovered that every time I click anything on the menu, it turns on Safe Mode. This would be aggravating to have to deal with all the time, especially since there’s still some menus I can’t even open, like emotes. Does anybody have any solution to this problem?",
