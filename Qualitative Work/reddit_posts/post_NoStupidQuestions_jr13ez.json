  "body": "Recently, I came across a questionable, verified Russian 18 year old on pornhub who was also a member of Modelhub, which seems like pornhub’s version of an onlyfans.\n\nI wanted to see if they verify girl’s ages thoroughly, as I’m pretty sure onlyfans does.\n\nHere is what I found: “Modelhub.com abides by the following procedures to ensure compliance:\n\nRequiring all users to be 18 years of age to upload videos. When uploading, user must verify the content; assure he/she is 18 years of age; certify that he/she keeps records of the models in the content and that they are over 18 years of age.”\n\nSo, TLDR: Do they not actually get any legal evidence of a persons age? Just their word for it?",
