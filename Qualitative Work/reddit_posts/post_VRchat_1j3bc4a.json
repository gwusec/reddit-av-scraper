  "body": "I think this should be the next natural step in VRCs security measures involving users who are minors.  There's already tags for suggestive, violent or disturbing avatars, but it doesn't prevent minors from using or seeing them.  I've seen kids that sound like they're ten years old running around in thick e-girl avatars with their boobs out before.  A simple system should be in place that takes advantage of the safety tag system that's already in place and the 18+ verification and make it mandatory that 18+ tagged avatars are not viewable by anyone not 18+ verified.",

I can see what that account is and I am gonna send your mom a video of what your doing\" They 90% of the time freak out and get off the headset.Edit:thank you so much spider queen for the award. It's my first award!"
