  "body": "As the title says. I am confused, do I HAVE to pay for the VRC+ membership to get Age Verified or can I get verified without it? No hate to the devs for wanting a premium membership for their free game, not gonna get into that can of worms, but I'd actually like to enjoy the game without people screaming out racial slurs or screaming kids in my ear.",

      "body": "Here is how it goes. You pay for VRC+ You go ahead and do the age verification process which is a few pictures and your ID After that it will take some time to process and you will have the option to show that on your profile.You DO NOT have to continue paying for VRC+ for it to stay on your profile"

But once you veridy, badge stays with you, no need to continue paying for subscribtion.You will be taken to Persona's website for verification and be asked to show both sides of your ID (photos or scan). Also you will need to give a scan of your face."
