  "body": "So my quest 2 stopped working, wanting my age verified, so go to the credit card id page, then it doesn't process the payment or tells me the id is not working, and around and around we go. No help from Meta of course just help pages. So I can't get further than this page, locked out of the account with emails saying if I don't verify by a certain date then everything is lost.\n\nAny one here with a solution?",
