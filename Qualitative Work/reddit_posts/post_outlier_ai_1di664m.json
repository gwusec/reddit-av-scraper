  "body": "Hello all. So, I am currently a student in Canada and applied for a position at Outlier. I was sent a link for onboarding. They needed to verify my ID using a Canadian issued ID. But the problem is that being a student, I dont have anything except the student visa, which basically is not an ID. I tried contacting support but have not heard back from them in 2 weeks. Any ideas?",

      "body": "Hi. I know this is an old-ish post, so I hope my feedback can be helpful. I am also an international student in Canada. Where I live (Alberta), as an international student (or any sort of temporal resident) you can get a Driver's license or an Alberta ID (in case you don't drive -like myself- or you don't want to go through the hassle of getting a license). I used that ID as verification in Outlier and I had no problems. I don't know if that works the same in other provinces, but getting my Alberta ID was super easy, I just went to a Registry (same place where you go for the Driver's licenses) with my study permit, passport and proof of address, paid the fee (I think it was about 35 dollars, I don't remember exactly) and I had my ID on the mail within a couple of days."
