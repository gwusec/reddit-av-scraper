  "body": "The developers need to do something about minors in the 18+ server. Like put age verification or something. I just encountered a minor who was bragging about the fact that they just turned 16, and they were only interested in people who are 18 and older. And then a random person came to defend them, come to find out they were a minor as well. Who was arguing that they could be on the 18+ server, because they were the age of consent in their state. I‚Äôm so done.",

I let them know that this was an 18+ server and not a safe place for them to be and to check out the safe server instead. They left, but looking back on it, I should have screenshotted and reported them. Who knows if they took my advice or not."

I totally understand kids will be kids and unfortunately that means getting curious and trying to bypass ways to access 18+ things but I remember seeing someone who admitted they were 10 on there- A bunch of people were telling them to get off and I just remember them saying at some point ‚Äúsilly adults, they think they know whats best for me‚Äù and I remember getting so SO concered for them. I should‚Äôve screenshotted who they were, but all I can do is hope they‚Äôre being safe."

Nothing will be done and sadly adults need to be used to being on guard about possibly accidentally talking to a minor pretending to be an adult and then the minors being open about being kids and being targeted by creeps. I dont wanna sound like a downer but ive been on this game for years and people complained and complained and nothing is ever done.edit: They have more important things to do like adding the abily to smile and nod and adding more cloths for the characters /s"
