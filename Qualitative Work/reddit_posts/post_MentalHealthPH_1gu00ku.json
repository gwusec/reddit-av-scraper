And the reason daw why di nag a-appear sa DOH website is binago daw nila ang format. Dati last 5 Digits lang pero ngayon you have to put in two ‚Äú00‚Äù before the last 5 Digits.\n\nHope this helps.",

      "body": "Hello. Pa-clarify lang po. Last 5 digits lang po pa ng ID number yung ilalagay plus two zeros? Meaning 7 digits lahat? So if for example \"12345\" yung last 5 digits mo, you have to input \"0012345\"? Tama po ba? I tried inputting both, (last 5 digits and then added 2 zeroes) pero pareho \"no records found\". I plan to contact my local LGU but I want to make sure tama ba yung ginagawa ko bago ako mangulit (I get anxiety trying to bring this up). Thank you for bringing this up."
