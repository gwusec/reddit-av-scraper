  "body": "Are you new to the game and stuck in public world hell where your experience so far has been screaming children and trolls?\n\nIt doesn't have to be that way!  Whether you're new to the game or you're looking for a place that could be right for you, joining a community may be what you're looking for.\n\nIf you're looking for a relaxed and chill space to hang out and meet new people, check out Stranger's Tavern. We are a modestly sized community that hosts casual hangout events, karaoke, audience anarchy, game nights, movie nights, and even occasionally special themed events like birthday parties and holiday parties. It's a great place to unwind after a long day and get to know new people. We are a safe-for-work community that is 18+, so no kids here.\n\nWe want to make you feel included! That's why every member is welcomed and encouraged to make an introduction so we can get to know a bit about you. We don't want you to feel like the guy standing in a corner because they don't know anyone, so we make an initiative to talk to you and get to know you-- especially helpful if you're someone that's receptive to someone talking to you first.  All you have to do is have some open-mindedness into meeting new people and take that first step of attending a hangout or even just saying hi in the chat :)  We are mute friendly so text boxes welcome!\n\nAnd we also want to get you involved! Participating in events or even general hangouts is a good first start if you feel like you're having some trouble getting out of your shell (or if you're a chatty person!) If you have an idea for events we want to hear it and get you further involved in the community!\n\nOne of the nice things about this community is it's a place where you are welcome to just be yourself. There's no hard emphasize on \"self improvement\" or a hard regimentalized structure. Just come in, hangout, and relax.\n\nDown below I've linked Stranger's Tavern and some other communities also worth checking out.",

That‚Äôs a semi-secret squirrel event tho‚Ä¶you‚Äôve to be in the know!!Those are special gatherings I host at Kibble‚ÄôsCurious Connections. Headpats are all about sharing gentle, platonic moments of comfort and connection. They require a sense of trust and vulnerability, which is why I keep these events small and exclusive. Please know that these spaces are safe and respectful, withZERO tolerancefor anything that might make others feel uncomfortable. It‚Äôs all aboutbuilding meaningful connectionswith like-minded folks.Exciting news‚Ä¶I‚Äôm collaborating with Eye of Veritas for a Dual-Community Collaboration‚Äîa combo VR Fitness-Headpat event. I also have in the works a Community Trifecta event, A Very Curious Coalescence of three very special communities!!ALSO, a flashmob planned for the future, once I‚Äôve trained enough headpatters‚ÄîFlashmob Pat Pals: Spreading comfort in the community, one pat at a timeüêæüíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
