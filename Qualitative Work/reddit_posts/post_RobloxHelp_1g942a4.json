  "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m 26 years old and have set my Roblox account to reflect that I’m an adult. However, I’m experiencing some issues related to age verification.\n\nCurrent Status: My account is set to 13+.\n\nIssue: I’m unsure if I need to provide additional verification, like a state ID or driver’s license, or if my current settings are sufficient since I used my state id on my third account to verify my age as it was corrected.\n\nQuestions:\n\nHas anyone else faced similar issues?\n\nWhat steps should I take to ensure my account is fully compliant?\n\nIs there any specific documentation I need to prepare?\n\nAny advice or insights would be greatly appreciated!",
