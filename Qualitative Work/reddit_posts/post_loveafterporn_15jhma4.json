  "body": "IOS tip! Game changer!\n\nIf your PA has an iPhone… and you have their passcode… Go to settings > Name, Phone number, email > (at the top above their email) edit > add email or phone number > add an email address > add your iCloud email. You should change your password so that they can’t log in to your email. This allows their phone to recognize the iCloud email. You will receive a verification code on your iCloud, follow those steps. Now for the best part…\n\nGo to settings > screen time > (bottom of the page) Turn on screen time > Content & Privacy Restrictions > tab the button on …\n\nFrom here I started at ITunes & App Store Purchases >\n\nInstalling Apps - allow\n\nDeleting Apps - don’t allow\n\nIn App Purchases - don’t allow Then back to C&PR page > Allowed Apps > Click on every app that you are okay with Back to C&PR page > content restrictions > turn explicit options to clean, don’t allow or allow, age rating limit etc. > back to content restrictions > WEB CONTENT > Limit Adult Websites > (bottom of the page) Never Allow/ add website >https://example.com(individually add in each website that your PA is sneaky with) > go back to Screen Time page. > Use screen time passcode > set a passcode > Screentime Passcode recovery pops up > Enter your iCloud email and your password. Now, they can no longer use incognito, erase website history, or even get on these websites. If there’s a loophole website look into it. I blocked the OF website and tried to get to it using Facebook…it blocked it and required the screentime passcode to use! They cannot turn off the screentime option without the passcode.\n\nI’m sure that this isn’t bulletproof BUT it’s really nice! You can get on the PA’s phone whenever you want to look at screentime, it will also list every website visited and for how long. I hope this helps someone. It’s definitely helping my sanity. I don’t feel the need to check his phone 24/7 and he doesn’t seem to be on it as much now…hmmm…\n\nMy PA isn’t a computer guy so this is flawless for me ATM. We also use “share my location”, when you click on your PA’s text message name, you click “share my location” and you’ll have a live location every time. A little reassuring.",

      "body": "literally DO NOT do this unless you are super prepared for what you’re going to find.we had a huge blowout discovery about a month ago where he put all these blockers on his phone and did this whole song and dance about not watching anymore.well he’s admitted to slipping up a couple of times in the past few weeks. whenever I asked what he was watching, he told me he couldn’t remember and didn’t think about it too much.since I found out he was still using, he’s been incredibly cold and distant. never having time to talk to me or interact with me. Thursday night i installed a tracker on the computer while he was sleeping. Friday as I was walking into work (7:14 in the morning), I got an alert and a screenshot that he was watching “trans traps” on a discord server.I never really knew what he was into before but having the proof at the exact time it was happening really shook me to my core and i can’t get any of the images out of my head.so, be safe and please only take these types of measures if you’re actually prepared for what you might uncover."

      "body": "This isn’t necessarily to track so to speak…it’s a blocker. It prevents him from viewing things and getting pop ups (over the phone) that would trigger him back into his old ways while he actively makes an effort to change 🤷🏻‍♀️ But I totally understand what you’re saying and that would be awful."
