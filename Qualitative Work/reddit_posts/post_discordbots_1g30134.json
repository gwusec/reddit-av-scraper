      "body": "You need a valid photo ID to verify your identity to verify a bot. It also has to be part of a team and you can invite other members to the team with various roles. I'm not sure if other members of the team such as admins can apply for the verification or if you must be owner of the team(you can transfer ownership of the team). But as far as I see I don't see an actual age requirement looking."
