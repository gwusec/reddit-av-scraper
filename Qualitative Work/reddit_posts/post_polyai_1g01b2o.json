  "body": "Some people seem to be a bit confused or don't seem to understand. I am pretty sure this is an age verification system. If you take a look anyone below the age of 14 can not continue. Ages between 14-17 are allowed to continue, but will start in pure mode. To shut off pure mode you must be 18+ to turn it off. Once the issues with the search system are fixed your age category will reflect what you can and can not search for.\n\nI do hope they fix the search issues soon and hopefully add in the ability to fine tone the search by adding filters.",
