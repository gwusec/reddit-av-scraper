  "body": "I am an NSFW erotic parody comic artist. Everything I do is legal, and I’d like to keep it that way. As I’m looking for an adult voice over actress to do voice over work to “dub” a visual novel, I fall into the problem of how do I verify that they are of legal age to do the work? Adult VAs (Voice Actors) prefer to keep their anonymity, as do I. Through hours of research, the best option I’ve found is a 3rd party verification service, however I’ve yet to find one that isn’t built upon AI guessing someone’s age. Does anyone have any recommendations? I would like to use this service 2-3 times a year.",

      "body": "You can use the Ripple Discord server to verify age anonymously, using givernment-issued IDs that only the server admins ever see, but I would advise against it. Knowing the identities of people you work with protects your business in many ways. It makes contracts enforceable and gives you recourse if the other person commits a crime against you or starts badmouthing you. Depending on where you live or sell your content, voice actors in animated adult videos may also be subject to age verification record keeping requirements."
