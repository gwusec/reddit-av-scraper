  "title": "AGE VERIFICATION!! THANKS",
  "body": "I just got a UI popup fromclaude.aiasking me to confirm that I'm 18 or older via ticking a checkbox. This implies that Anthropic is going the route of providing more mature / adult themed content via lessening their legal burden for providing it. However let's hope they don't fall under pressure of jurisdictions like Texas that require photo ID to be digitally transmitted and verified and tied to your account for age verification... Let's just keep this easily bypassable mechanism in place for perceived lawsuit induced investor anxiety while trying to appeal to paying end users! Thx",

Kissing, the slightest violence, the barest reference to anything sexual in nature. It significantly impacted its usefulness for that sort of thing. It would even edit out any swearing without being asked to."
