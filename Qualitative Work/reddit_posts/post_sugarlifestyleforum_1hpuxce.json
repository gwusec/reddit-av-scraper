Is this new?\n\nUpdate: This message as a PM from Seeking (and in case you were wondering if Seeking reps were lurking in this sub):\n\nHi, Yes, thatâ€™s correct! Seeking has recently implemented a new process that requires ID verification during sign-up. This is part of our ongoing efforts to enhance security and ensure a safe environment for all users. If you need further details, please reach out tosupport@seeking.com. Thank you.",

      "body": "Yes, it's true.  That way when their database gets hacked the perpetrators will have every user's id and photo plus all their profile and message content.  I know Seeking says it's handled by a 3rd party, but everything you put out on the Internet is subject to being hacked.  This verification system is why I'll never have a Seeking account again."

      "body": "This all started when I tried to renew my membership using a prepaid Visa card. I tried it with two different cards, and it didnâ€™t let me renew. When I tried to create a new account, it asked me for a live selfie ID verification. Even though Iâ€™ve never been into anything nefarious, or scammed anyone, Iâ€™ve always liked my anonymity on these sites. (I still remember well the Ashley Madison leak from 2015.) Looks like one more reason to bail on Seeking."
