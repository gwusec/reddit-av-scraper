  "body": "Hello everybody, A couple of days ago I got my confirmation email, finally off the wait-list. However, I saw that they require newcomers to upload an ID. How did y'all feel about this? Because, honestly I feel a little bit uneasy sharing that kind of information. Is it really trustworthy/safe?",

Is it safe to give them all this information?Yes. Prolific never sees your ID itself; they use a third-party service called Onfido to verify your identity and make sure you're old enough to be on the platform. They need your PayPal information to pay you, and your demographics are how you get selected for studies. Your identity is never revealed to the researchers - all they ever see is your general demographics, and an anonymous Prolific ID number. If researchers ever requestpersonally identifying information, especially usernames and passwords, return the study andnotify Prolific."
