  "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m encountering a specific issue with my G-Snack vending machine equipped with the Nayax payment system, and I’m hoping someone might have experienced something similar or could provide some advice.\n\nHere’s the problem: •\tFor products requiring age verification, the machine does not accept card payments. However, these same products can be purchased without any issues when using cash. •\tFor non-age-restricted products, card payments work perfectly fine.\n\nDoes anyone know if there are additional settings or configurations required in Nayax for card payments on age-restricted products? Could this be a limitation from the payment provider side, or is there a known workaround?\n\nAny guidance or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you!",
