  "body": "Hello everyone, good morning,\n\nI am facing an issue and would like to know if anyone has experienced this before? I am in the process of opening a courier account with Just Eat. I received an email to complete the Sterling background check, but before that, I needed to undergo a YOTI check. When I tried to complete the YOTI check, there was an error in the application, and I couldn't retry. I have been waiting for over a month, and they have not sent a new link for me to redo the YOTI check. Does anyone know an email address I can contact Just Eat on to resolve this?\n\nThank you.",
