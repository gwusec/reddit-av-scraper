When science demonstrates that, for example, greater youth access to social media entails greater youth mental health issues, the government should take action to limit youth access to social media and thus combat youth mental health issues, which is certainly an honourable endeavor."

Don't be so hasty in supporting it.What helps with the issues you're describing ismedia literacy, not a dystopian surveillance state. There is no reason for us to allow - much less trust - arbitrary private companies with such personal information.You are being remarkably short sighted here."
