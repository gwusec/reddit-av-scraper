  "body": "After my friend spent ages trying to persuade me to get the app I finally bit the bullet and tried making my account. I entered my day of birth (which is allowed within the app) however when it came to the age verification point it doesn't work. I follow the instructions until I get to a point where it says 'center you face' and doesn't continue further when I do this. I have also tried different lighting's and even got to a point where I put my friend in the frame believing it was my face at fault however that didn't work either. I have tried closing and reopening the app, deleting and reinstalling the app and tried resetting my phone multiple times however I still have this problem. I have tried contacting Wizz support however I have not heard anything back in 2 weeks. If anyone knows how to fix this that would be greatly appreciated.",
