ESPECIALLY with how these bills are being written, so that any social media site will technically fall under the same requirements. They're not even trying to make the motions make sense, or be descriptiveat all.They're clearly trying to tie real identities to the internet in an effort to remove internet anonymity altogether. There's basically zero protections, and they're forcing each corporation to handle the PII themselves --- that's INSANE!We can't even keep our governmental systems from being hacked, why should we be providing PII that can fully be used for identity theft to every single internet-based shared-media service? The same corporations that are getting hacked and leaking massive amounts of dataconstantly."

You expect that kind of thing from red states, where elected leaders care more about what powerless people do in their bedrooms than what powerful people are doing to their wallets. But blue states getting in on it baffles me. Where is the support for sexual freedom?"

Such information is useless for blackmail, and anyone using that argument for being in favor of age verification is being dumb. The same cannot be said for NSFW content, for which there exist strong stigmas and biases that can harm you.Most of the groups advocating for age verification are industry lobbyist groups and their proxies, and the sooner people realize that the better. These companies want to get rich off of their services being mandated for everything imaginable."
