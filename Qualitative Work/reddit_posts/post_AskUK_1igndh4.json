  "body": "I recently signed-up to the Playstation store. It needed my date of birth (I am in my 40s), and then the sign-up procedure wanted to verify my age.\n\nIt provided three options: facial scan (\"take a photo of your face for age estimation\"), ID (\"upload your passport or driving license or ID card\"), and mobile number (\"use a verification code sent as a text message to your mobile phone\").\n\n\"By selecting facial scan or ID you will be redirected to Yoti's website.\"\n\nI selected the mobile phone option as this was the least intrusive and received a SMS code which I entered to continue the sign-up procedure.\n\nQuestion: how on earth is it possible to prove someone is an adult (let alone their specific age) because they have a mobile phone?\n\nLet's forget about the fact that people can use other people's phones or receive SMS messages from online services - if a child / teenager / adult was using their actual phone - how would receiving and entering an SMS prove they are an adult?\n\nEDIT: based on the initial comments, it seems there are two schools of thought. The first is that those on a contract mobile phone are likely to be over 18 (although a parent may well have bought and paid for a contract for someone under 18). The second is that the mobile phone provider is sharing some level of name and age details with Sony (https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/account/age-verification-faq/).",

      "body": "Because (postpaid, not PAYG) phone contracts in the UK typically require a person to be 18+ to sign up. So, if a phone number is linked to a contract, there‚Äôs areasonable(not 100%) chance it belongs to an adult. Also some online services canquery mobile networkoperators to check if a number is linked to an adult account.And ultimately, companies implementing age verification are more concerned with showing theytriedto check a user‚Äôs age rather than guaranteeing absolute proof.SMS verification offers a minimal-effort, low-friction method that satisfies regulators without being overly intrusive or frustrating adults who don‚Äôt want to upload ID. It also reduces drop-off rates in sign ups as people are more likely to complete verification if it‚Äôs convenient.In reality, it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äòspeed bump‚Äô (and deterrent to underage users) than a real age verification method, and anyone determined enough can bypass it easily."
