  "body": "Hi there,\n\nWhenever I wanna browse certain websites as well as watch certain videos on YouTube, it immediately pops up a Google page that forces me to enter my phone number and do a mandatory age verification, but when I enter my Tourist phone number, nothing works and it just says my number is INVALID. I got my tourist phone number from the airport and I do not have Korean ID card or any status because I'm just a nomad.\n\nHow do I bypass this annoying restriction besides having to use proxy apps?",
