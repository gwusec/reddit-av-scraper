  "body": "I want to test out an idea for cbd drink vending in a couple of locations I’ve secured, but age verification machines are either only on alibaba with high shipping costs or I can’t find them at all in the US unless they’re reselling the same ones from alibaba as a custom machine for 3k+.\n\nI’d be willing to rent one for 6-12 months, and have seen that a lot of machine leasing companies will pay the “property tax” for the machine per location. I can take care of the hemp retail permits and insurance.\n\nCan anyone here connect me with someone locally that provides a machine like this for rent?",

Seems the most popular are vape machines but I need a refrigerated drink machine.Guess my biggest problem here is sourcing one locally and short term"
