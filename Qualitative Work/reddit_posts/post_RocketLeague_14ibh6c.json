  "body": "I was so happy that finally put in something so when a player bails on their team in comp, the others can leave without penalty. Of course they left a loophole and it hasn’t taken long for it to spread throughout the player base.\n\nThe ones that really want to grief just wait until the match is halfway over and then that dip. You have no choice but to FF or abandon at that point. So a great idea gets halfway implemented and that is disappointing. Ranking up wasn’t so bad, too bad it didn’t last very long.\n\nI’d pay a premium price for a monthly sub to get rid of the kids that wouldn’t have access to unlimited email accounts and can create account after account because it’s free.\n\nHow about age verification if it stays free? Yea I know some adults think and behave like children and abandon matches too but will they do it when they are paying to play? Some will, yes.\n\nI was enjoying ranking up but it’s becoming just as bad as it was before, sucks.",
