It has proven extremely helpful.No one has sent me any form of ID, and looking at their face has been a good way to start. I‚Äôve found that so far I‚Äôve only had 2 people under age (determined by face) And the rest have been all older than that. I have been basically doing this by seeing what facial features, tattoos, hair (colour and texture) and all kinds of other things.But now I‚Äôve got an OF set up, I‚Äôm going to direct people there and follow other commenters advice by directing people to a site with age verification"
