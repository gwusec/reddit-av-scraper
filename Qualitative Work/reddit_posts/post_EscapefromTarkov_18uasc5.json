  "body": "Issue is in the title.\n\nIt seems that many people with the same problem have changed their CPU recently. I myself just upgraded to 7900x3d and wanted to play this weekend. Now it's day two and i still don't recieve the mail. I've logged in to my friends account and the mail arrived instantly. I've tried running the launcher as admin, reinstalling the launcher and the game and tried o authenticate at least 200 times. No success. Whats left now is reinstall windows from scratch and change e-mail address. Weirdly, i got the mail instantly which confirmed my password reset. It has the same sender as the verfication mail,no-reply@escapefromtarkov.com, so it's not a spam filter issue.\n\nAll in all this is just sad. I've upgraded my pc for more than 1.6k $ to play these few vacation days and enjoy the game and the only thing i get is a freak error because they probably fucked around with cpu hardware id locks or something. Please fix it as fast as possible.\n\nEDIT: Nikita making fun of the issuehttps://www.twitch.tv/battlestategames/clip/ArtsyCarefulDootYouDontSay-WT6-5o9SQ6cwqB6O\n\nEDIT2: Just clean installed Windows, no change.\n\nEDIT3: Downgraded to Win 10, still not working. Funny enough the verification code from the website login being delivered within seconds to the gmail backup account.\n\nEDIT4: So it seems that anyone affected by this needs to try and change their e-mail address to gmail. I've never seen anyone have this issue with a gmail account. For some reason, changing e-mail is greyed out for me so i created yet another support ticket to let them change it for me.",

I'm a hotmail user and I remember it sometimes being troublesome in the past but I haven't been able to get a single verification email in 2 days after trying every solution under the sun  (upgraded PC parts 2 days ago) .Seeing these new twitch clips too of them not caring at all makes me realize I've probably lost my 3200 hour EOD account. What a fucking shame..."
