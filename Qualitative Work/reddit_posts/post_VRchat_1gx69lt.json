  "body": "A badge on your profile showing that youâ€™ve verified your age through VRChatâ€™s application. Cost: $5. Instances can also be age restricted, allowing only people with the badge in. Just an idea. Before you say this wouldnâ€™t work, it would. IMVU has the feature and it works really well.",

Because every kid I knew as a kid knew how to bypass every single age-verification that did not involve money.Money is the only thing bad parents care about, so that's why money-based verification services work. Kid charges something to a parent's card. Parent finally cares about what their neglected child is doing."
