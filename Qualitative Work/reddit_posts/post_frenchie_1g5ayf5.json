  "body": "Hopefully someone is able to help me out, I found this sweet girl about 9 months ago wandering the streets of my mom‚Äôs neighborhood. I went around nearby houses asking if they recognized her and no one did. I put up posters, made posts about her on our nextdoor app and other social media platforms. I also took her to the vet to get checked for a chip, she didn‚Äôt have one. About 2 months into having her in my care I decided to keep her. I was wondering if anyone could tell me her age? Vet told me she was about 3 years old but I‚Äôm led to believe she‚Äôs a bit older. Any information would be appreciated greatly! Thanks!",

I‚Äôd go by what a frenchie familiar vet says, they usually age by their teeth  and hair ( I think by how much white or grey that they have) mine is almost seven and her muzzle and chin has a bit of whiteness your baby‚Äôs muzzle looks pretty dark so she‚Äôs younger than that."

      "body": "When I rescued my baby, I was told that she was 3-4 years old. The vet took one look at her teeth and said she was 6. I was able to get previous vet records down the road, and it turned out that she was exactly 6 when I had first taken her to the vet."

      "body": "My guess is somewhere between 3 and 5. She‚Äôs definitely had at least 1 litter of pups based on her larger nipples and breeders usually start breeding when they are around 2-3 years of age. But like others have said the vet usually bases it off the teeth and they‚Äôre usually pretty close.Edited to add: she‚Äôs adorable ü•∞"
