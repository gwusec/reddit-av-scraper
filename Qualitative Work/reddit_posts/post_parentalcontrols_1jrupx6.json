But letâ€™s be realâ€”kids under 13 are already on these platforms, often bypassing age verification with ease.",

      "body": "It's to sway people politically and make more money. I would say that a major portion of the results of the 2024 United States election are due to people being uneducated. Most of those voters couldn't point to Europe on a map. Without a platform for communication, without free speech, these <13 year olds will grow up to be redpilled because they were forced into echo chambers. Look at the people trying to implement these restrictions -- almost all politically right leaning. What will these companies and lawmakers get from that?More votesMore moneyMore powerCritical thinking and free speech are two important parts of social media. Israel was called out on TikTok, a platform of primarily adolescents and teens (hence why they tried to ban it entirely). Since they couldn't do that, they want to redpill these kids another wayAnyone who tells you it's to \"protect the children\" is in on it, or just plain stupid"
