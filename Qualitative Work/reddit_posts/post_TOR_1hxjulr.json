  "body": "Hi,i've found out there are extensions for tor which are firefox extensions. The problem is whenever i try log into tor for youtube,all this weird stuff starts happening and i cant log in,same for reddit. So is there something i can do to bypass all of this age verification stuff to view videos+posts on reddit? I've tried everything basically,including tamper monkey extensions and some github ones,please help! (btw i've posted this on the FIREFOX subreddit aswell)",

Because if you're trying to be anonymous you shouldn't be using clearnet accounts or trying to get around things with extensions because that's going to make you stand out. But if you're just trying to get around YouTube and Reddit restrictions, I don't think Tor is a good way to go about that."
