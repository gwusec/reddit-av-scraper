  "body": "I have been verified to do LIVE sessions. I went through the age verification process at the beginning and submitted my ID. This process was quick. However, a few days later, I couldn't go live because the system needed to verify my age again. According to the live support agent, it was a glitch, and it was resolved in 5 hours, allowing me to go live again.\n\nYesterday, on Monday, I went live at noon for two hours without any issues. However, when I tried to go live in the evening, I was once again prohibited from doing so due to the age verification process. TikTok has apologized and is trying to fix it.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this? Have you had to go through the verification process more than twice? If so, how long did it take you to get it resolved?",
