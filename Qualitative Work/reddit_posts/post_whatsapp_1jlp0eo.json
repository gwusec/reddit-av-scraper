  "body": "For a club that I am in everybody decided to use whatsapp to communicate to each other. I downloaded whatsapp onto my phone and put in my phone number and stuff, but when I put in the date I was born it just says \"Confirming age....\" forever. My phone sucks, so I gave it a while, but it never loaded. I closed and reopened the app many times and re-entered my date, but it never worked. I even tried to put in a different date to see if It would work and it just doesn't.\n\nPlease help me.",

So after trial and error I just added a birth year of 2000 and it magically worked. It didn't ask for month or day. Not sure if you want to give that a try."
