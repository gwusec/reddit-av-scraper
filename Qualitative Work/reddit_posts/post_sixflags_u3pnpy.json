  "body": "My child is going to turn 3 during the year, she is quite tall for her age as a 2-year-old (over 95 percentile). I have 3 season passes for the family of 4 of us. I have 2 questions:\n\nWill six flags require anything or do anything to verify the age of my youngest?\n\nSo am I required to buy another pass at the end of summer when she turns 3? Would likely just get a day pass and season pass for her next season.\n\n\n\nThanks",

When entering the gates when my son was 2, I would just show the passes for the older ones and then say, “Kid in the stroller is 2.”  That’s it.  Maybe somebody will look at you funny, but even that didn’t really happen.  Even though my 2 year old was so big he was in 5T clothes!"

Older is in bottom 10 percentile for age and younger is in top 90 percentile for age. Both walk in with strollers, show ID and they never bother to ask for the ones in the stroller."
