  "body": "So for the past few week I've been trying to verify my age using my citizen identity card. Every time I try it I get an error saying the pictures are invalid, after a few failed attempts it says \"Contact support\" and when I contact support they say that they can't do anything at all. Once they said something different:\n\n\"If you have followed all steps to upload a valid, accepted ID and are still having problems verifying, please reply with the following information:\n\nScreenshot or copy/paste of any error code or message\n\nPlease note: Do NOT include any images of your ID or selfie in your screenshots\n\nAdditional details about the issue\"\n\nAnd when I followed his instructions and sent it to them (both by gmail and support) they said they can't do anything about age verification (just like the other ones) and this has been pissing me off lately.After all that I decided to use my brothers American phone number (I live in Mongolia) and finally got voice chat but after a few hours it just disappears. The phone number is still there and verified but the voice chat option is gone.",
