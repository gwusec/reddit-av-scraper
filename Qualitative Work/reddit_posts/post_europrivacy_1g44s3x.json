      "body": "Limiting teens from using social media requires being able to figure out the age of every social media user.Social media platforms do this already. It's one of the datapoints super important for advertisers. Remember you're the product of social media, so they need to know everything about you.That's why one should avoid social media...What the government is proposing is a national social media age verification scheme. Or, to put it plainly, every Australian is going to have to prove their age when they go online in a way that they never have before. Maybe it’s by showing government ID, a credit card, or some other way — whatever the method, it’s a bump that’s going to be felt by each of us.Maybe yes, maybe not.Again, social media already know the age of its users pretty well.Privacy needs to be balanced against other values, obviously.This is a very interesting case because there's tons of research that points towards the harm of social media on kids (and adults, for that matter)."
