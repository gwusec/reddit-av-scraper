  "body": "So I’m 21 and I play Avakin like any normal person and I have been considering purchasing the age verification badge. However there was one person that said apparently there is an age verification meta thing where people can see what age you are. I just wanted to ask if this is true or not and I would absolutely love it if an LKWD moderator could confirm this for me because I don’t want people knowing my age through a badge, I like my privacy and so I just wanted to ask if anyone can confirm if this is true or not and I did read that the age verification thing isprivate and confidential, but is this true about how players can see your age apparently with the badge especially the age verification badge",

I can 1000% confirm this as well as that nothing is saved or passed around about your data as they apparently save nothing (it's an ai that assesses IF you are over 18 only and does so in like 2 seconds live).You international wanted-by-interpol players are safe on avakin life (just be careful where you spend those stolen c-notes and the queen's jewels).👻😎☕️"
