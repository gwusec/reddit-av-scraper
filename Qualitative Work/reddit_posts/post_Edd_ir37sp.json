  "body": "Just trying to help him anyone that’s been dealing with verifying your identity with EDD. I myself had been waiting for months and called the 866-401-2849 number which is their IV department and I never can reach anyone. Someone suggested on here to fax them so I went ahead and did that and surprisingly I received a phone call with an unknown number in a couple days. So if you’re trying to reach that department go ahead and FAX them and hopefully you get the help you need.\n\nFAX #916-653-2734",

But with the new system they're implementing I would wait until 10/5, unless you have to do it asap. Then I would Ask them to send you a request to upload your Id info. Then you will get an email regarding ID verification."
