  "body": "A few months ago, Instagram introduced a user age verification feature using artificial intelligence in collaboration with Yoti. This is to ensure the safety of underage users who are constantly threatened by various cases of sexual harassment that have been reported.\n\nThis feature is now being launched in Brazil and India because, according to the Sensor Tower report by TechCrunch, there are more than 400 million active Instagram users every month in these two countries. Then this feature was also introduced because more and more users under 13 years old are using their platform.\n\nBy requiring all users to fill in their date of birth, it is also inevitable that many can cheat â€“ so age verification using this intelligence is a new solution. Not only that, but theSocial Vouchingfeature of getting age verification from friends has also been terminated. Only uploading a photo of an identity card or document using Yoti is allowed.\n\nInstagram also limits the use of its platform to users under the age of 16 by making their accounts private by default, blocking the DM feature from adult users, and stopping the display of ads based on the patterns of underage users.\n\nWhat types of ID does Instagram accept?",
