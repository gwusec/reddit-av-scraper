  "body": "Hello everyone, I am fairly new to the idea of selling content on Reddit through various subreddits for different things. I am understanding that on most pages sellers need to go through a verification process, so I am working on meeting the requirements. I have seen talk about sellers requesting age verification from buyers, how is this done? and what are the different methods used? (if not directing them to SP or OF or some other already aged verified site) Thanks for the help xoxo",
