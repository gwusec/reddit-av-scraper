  "body": "I‚Äôm 21 years old, says it in my bio, and I still get hounded for my age whenever I join a non +18 instance. I cannot count on two hands how many times I‚Äôve been kicked for asking why I need my age verified to play something like spook em up. It‚Äôs always someone who sounds like they‚Äôre 16 too. Am I going crazy?? Are other people getting tired of it too??\n\nI know that just saying my age would fix the problem, but I just get so irked when I join a normal (non +18) instance and am questioned immediately. Not to mention, if you hesitate slightly you‚Äôre gone. I‚Äôm half tempted to get vrc+ just to get into +18 instances without the power trip.",

Even if a kid doesn't have a deep /older sounding voice they can fake it or use a voice changer . I've seen people getting mutes to type out the age and dob which is , well it's great they support mutes , but makes the whole thing even more pointless."

EVERY SINGLE ONE was locked and had eboys sitting at the front desk asking for age and date of birth. I stood there for like a minute in silence and they thought I was going to \"do something\" and threatened to kick me. It was one of the most cringe things I've seen in this game. They don't care about your VRC+ age verification either."
