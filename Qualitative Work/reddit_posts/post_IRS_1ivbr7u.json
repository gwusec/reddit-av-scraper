  "body": "First year filing taxes, and I tried to make an account for IRS. They use ID.me, and a few weeks ago, I tried and they couldn't verify my identity despite me having a valid drivers license and SS card. Tried again today and they still couldn't verify it, so they made me send pics of proof of identity and said they'll send an email in 2-3 days for a video call. I really need to make an account cause I need a form to send to my university, and the sooner I send it, the sooner they can process my FAFSA. Have y'all had issues verifying with ID.me, and if so, how did y'all fix it?",
