  "body": "I tried to play Pillar Chase 2 today, but I notice I couldn't because it's \"restricted\" behind that age verification thing. The problem is I never once messed around with it, and apparently 10 days ago roblox changed my birth date to 2018. Effectively making me a child in their eyes despite me being a grown adult.\n\nSo, I tried to change it, and the persona verification system is not accepting my state ID. I've contacted support, but they just said the same things I was already trying to do. I took photos from the left, right, zoomed in on my face, and still nothing is working. Is there any method to get past this or is my account done for?",
