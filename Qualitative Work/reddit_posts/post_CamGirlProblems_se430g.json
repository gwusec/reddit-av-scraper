  "body": "hey all! if you've ever tried to make a model/creator account on PH or xhamster, you've probably had to do that YOTI verification thing where you scan your chosen document and do a face scan. that's all well and good, but i've never been able to get it to accept my state ID. every time it claims that it's too blurry, which i understood when i was using my webcam, but i've also tried my phone camera and got the same result. anyone else have this issue/know any workarounds??",
