  "body": "Has anyone else had this problem? Patreon is all of a sudden demanding I verify my age. This must be the second email I've gotten about it this month. But the only form of certification they've offered is state ID, real personal stuff. They've said they're going to create alternatives, but at the same time, they're all but demanding I verify my age right now or they're going to start delaying payouts. All the while they haven't actually put forth any alternate forms of verification yet.\n\nIs anyone else having this problem, or do they know of an alternate form of ID that Patreon has introduced but aren't being one hundred percent transparent about for whatever reason?",
