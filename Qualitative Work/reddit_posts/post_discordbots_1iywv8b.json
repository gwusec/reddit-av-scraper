This restricts their view to #rules and #verify.In #Verify, there's a react role message (set up via Carlbot), asking \"What's your age?\"13-15 16-17 18-20 etcIf a user selects an >18 role, Carlbot will give them the 'Minor' role which removes all view perms except to a channel called #read-me that explains that they're underage to view the server and gives them the ability to create a ticket to age verify.If they select an +18 role, it gives them the corresponding role and also gives them #member that grants access to the rest of the server"
