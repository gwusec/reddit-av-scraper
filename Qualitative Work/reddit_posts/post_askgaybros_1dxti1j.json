      "body": "Agreed!Same thing but more illegal happened to me...He lied about his age, we chat, he sends a pic & his hand looks young... so I asked again & sure enough...As I was cussing him out for sending that shit to people, he blocked me. I reported it to Grindr on both the app & Twitter, got nothing. I freaked a bit (ain't getting strung up for child porn) so I called the FBI who told me I had to contact the Center for Missing & Exploited Children. So I did... brief chat, nothing.Yeah, it went a bit far for a dick pic, but I be damned if some idiot teenager is getting me jailed over their fun time..  to hell with that. Under 18, DON'T SEND PICS!!"

      "body": "This happened to a friend's son. He was 19 and thought he was chatting and exchanging pics with a19 yr old girl. He got caught up in a swat action and was arrested. The girl was 16. Nothing happened to her. My friend spent close to $100 large defending his son including some 30-day mandatory program if he wanted to avoid a sex offender label. Again, nothing happened to the girl, at all. Something tells me she was part of the trap and if so, that's just shitty."
