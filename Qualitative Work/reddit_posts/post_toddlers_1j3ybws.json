Most start charging admission for children 3+.\n\nI feel like I could try, but my son is pretty big. At 2yr 8m, he’s 40lbs and about 38inches tall. Wears mostly 3T.So I’m sure he’ll be bigger by the fall.\n\nNow that im writing this and imagining him bigger, i don’t think he’ll pass as a 2yr old 😂",

We actually got a weird look going to a swimming pool last summer, the check in guy said “wow that’s a tall three year old…” (the price for 3 and under was free at this particular place). But he was three!My kids are also chatty and love to correct me when I’m wrong so I’m sure if I lied to a cashier and my kid overheard me he would loudly correct me and tell them his actual age, so I really want to avoid that 🤣"

You as the adult should probably avoid putting your kids in such situations(not you specifically, just parents in general)."

As the museum counter lady said “But madam, he has a beard! He looks well over 20.” She replied:”He does. It happened very young to him. It’s a sensitive topic.”Edit: don’t think I will continue this behavior, as my parents both have a fundamental honesty problem."
