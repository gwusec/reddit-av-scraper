A game site I play, has asked for a photo of my driver‚Äôs license with myself in it, as I am today, and they have used it for nothing but ensuring I am the owner of my account.Now, I am not saying you should have to show your driver‚Äôs ID, but a bank card or something should be ‚Äùfor the legal age‚Äù, and able to prove that too. I mean, maybe one day we can be ID‚Äôd by our bank- or credit cards‚Ä¶"
