Again, I have no idea what they will do with my data regardless of the fact they say it will be discarded.They don't sayhowit will be discarded, they don't talk about any rolling backups they should have, they don't talk about security - and even if they did I don't trust them.I predominantly use Discord for games I like in Early Access so I can give feedback, upload logs etc. Game devs using these 'tools' means I pass. I cannot be the only one."

The Online Safety Act requires \"highly effective age assurance\" if your user-to-user communication service would appeal to children but shouldn't be viewed by them. Video games firmly fall into this category. And there's no standard of \"highly effective\" that doesn't include processing of some kind of personal data."
