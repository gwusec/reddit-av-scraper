If you are permanently banned you know why. You will receive a banner like the one below.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/imgres?q=permanently%20banned%20wizz&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fbanned-for-no-reason-v0-okwwwj1ml8sb1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D43e2b771d44d96a738c44a340263b10a456082b9&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FWizz_App_Unofficial%2Fcomments%2F16zw5x1%2Fbanned_for_no_reason%2F&docid=tC4aWu9QGq9aiM&tbnid=yK6qryf1WHscjM&vet=12ahUKEwiZ_a34jNCJAxU7mYkEHTI2Hy8QM3oECBYQAA..i&w=1080&h=2337&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwiZ_a34jNCJAxU7mYkEHTI2Hy8QM3oECBYQAA\n\nShadow banned - This is the worst case scenario. The bans are indefinite. This can happen for a multitude of reasons. See AI & Verification below for more information. Reference this guide for circumvention:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Wizz_App_Unofficial/comments/1g8eh95/comment/lt0i19g/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nFor more information:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nALL BANS ARE TIED TO THE DEVICE IMEI NUMBER. THIS A UNIQUE 15-CHARACTER STRING THAT IDENTIFIES A MOBILE DEVICE AND CANNOT BE CHANGED OR ALTERED. PLEASE DO NOT ROOT YOUR DEVICE IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING. I DO NOT CONDONE DAMAGING YOUR DEVICE TO BYPASS A BAN.\n\nUPDATE 16/11/2024: THE THIRD PARTY SERVICE KNOWN ASYOTIHAS MADE UPDATES. YOUR BIOMETRIC PROFILE IS HELD AND CROSSCHECKED BETWEEN ACCOUNTS. THIS CAUSES BAN CIRCUMVENTION TO FAIL. FOR THE TIME BEING PLEASE USE ANOTHER PERSONS FACE UNTIL A SOLUTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBanned words on wizz: Insta/Instagram/ig or any combination as such (If you know of any more please comment so we can keep this updated.)\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n“Our goal is for every user to enjoy a safe and positive time on Wizz, which is why we’ve integrated a wide array of safety features right from sign-up.”\n\nSafety features were put in place after the app was removed from the app store in February of 2024. Users publicly stated that there were a high level of scammers leading to users to be victims of sextortion and financial loss. This lash back led to internal and external audits of Wizz by the App Store and Google Play Store respectfully. Once the App was deemed ‘Safe for users’ the app returned to the respective stores. The new platform is much safer than the old as it mitigated malicious users. That being said, these additions have caused much headache for users, decreasing overall user experience and functionality.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThird parties include:\n\nBesedo: Text moderation\n\nSightengine: Image moderation\n\nYoti: Age Verification Using Biometrics\n\nAWS Machine Learning: Image Verification Using Biometrics\n\nFramer: Web Builder (See view-source:https://URL)\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWizz: Scripts were also added into the backend. Most of the frontend UI is written entirely in swift. Backend consists of Python, Ruby, SQL and some other shit that's irrelevant. Wizz uses Google Cloud for its operations, including Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub, and BigQuery. Wizz also uses Redis Enterprise on Google Cloud to scale its app as it grows in popularity. Advertising on Wizz is done through AppLovin Max and Unity, the major players used by almost all mobile applications in the industry. On these ad networks, all illegal, hateful, violent, sexual, political, or otherwise inappropriate advertisements are blocked from being published within Wizz (no sexual advertisements...riiight).\n\nYoti: Audited every year, the ID verification service holds the stringent ISO 27001 certificate. This certificate is recognized as the international standard for ISMS compliance.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nALL IMAGES/MESSAGES ARE HELD BY THIRD PARTIES AND MODERATED PRIOR TO BEING SENT. ALL DATA IS ERASEDSIX MONTHSAFTER ACCOUNT DELETION UNLESS SUBPOENAED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSee:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Wizz_App_Unofficial/comments/1gcth3r/comment/ltx8hkz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\nThis user may have been moderated with a DISTANCE FLAG.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThis gets asked everyday. Show your face clearly. Utilize tags. Add photos that make you appealing and interesting (not weird). 3-4 photos max. Do not flood your profile with text. Add your favorite music! Post your profile in the sub for some ‘constructive criticism’. Lol.\n\nUtilizeBulk ChatandBoost. The best time to use these are night or morning.\n\nRemember your first photo is the most important.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThere isn’t and that needs to change. It’s a bot which is okay for some situations, but others it is useless. Many users are helpful on the sub regarding technical/non-technical issues. Dm’s are open. Don’t be stupid.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSearchTeen Appswherever you get your apps.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBugs? In an app with lots of users! Unheard of! Realistically, a somewhat okay solution to this is turning off automatic updates for Wizz. You run the risk of a missing patch (compromising the security of the app), but sustain functionality for the time beaing.\n\nFrom what I have seen there are a few bugs (no disclosures as such). I am looking into a few of them and figuring out a work around. They do have some good devs at VLB. Isn’t that right, Aymeric? You too Thomas.\n\nFor those of you that don't know Wizz is a subsidiary of VLB, as such they are not a major priority to a company that has a multitude of apps to'take care of'.\n\nBUG REPORT: PLEASE DM ONLY. AGAIN NOTHING STUPID. TY :)\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nUpdate: BUG REPORT 11/17/24\n\nWeb fuzzing with FFUF led to:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fq1adccliui1e1.jpeg\n\nON IOS ONLY.\n\nWU: rfihub was used at some time. This doesn't really bypass anything or count for privilege escalation, but it does give us some insight as to the adware being used in the backend. This adware is known to be malicious and associated with malware on MAC. The site is no longer active.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThen get off the sub and delete the app.Stop your bitching.I- I mean kind hearted remarks.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHope this helps everyone.\n\nSincerelyu/-St4t1c-",
