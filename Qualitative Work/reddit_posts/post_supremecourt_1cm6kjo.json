  "body": "I'm a normal person I don't have any law degrees or really any deep knowledge of supreme court cases or decisions so about 2-3 weeks ago I found this sub trying to get more informed about the supreme court and the most popular post that I seen was the whole age id verification for online porn I've been reading comments and reading the cert petition, posts from Free Speech Coalition and ACLU posts, and the opinion piece that was posted here and all of this has me confused. I'm seeing free speech coalition and ACLU basically saying here's why this is unconstitutional using RENO v ACLU, and Ashcroft v ACLU and maybe some other cases I don't remember and how the 5th circuit went against years of precedent set by the supreme court, the opinion piece basically said that since they declined the stay that the supreme court is going against precedents that will in long run probably end up with people having to use their id to basically use the internet.\n\nI've read comments both saying how this is and isn't constitutional also using some of the same decisions I've mentioned and obscenity laws and how you get carded for alcohol and cigarettes so it makes sense to do the same here to how this court isn't that much different than the court in 08 that did Ashcroft and how the supreme court has been more in favor with free speech. With the supreme court not giving a reason why they decided not to stay the 5th circuits decision all this all together has left me very confused from everything that I've read to me it seems like the supreme court would just continue with the prior precedents that has been establish right or would new ruling be made that would basically overturn all the prior decisions like Ashcroft? How do cases like this work cause reading all the comments the posts from FSC and ACLU and the opinion piece makes it seem like it can go either way and with a lower court going against prior supreme court decisions how do cases like this get decided?",

      "body": "From the perspective of a web developer, our rights to speech have been under extreme attack lately.  There really is no great way to check someone's ID online (and per Texas law, also not keep any records of it).  The whole law was written to make it virtually impossible to comply.  There is a false equivalence of adult bookstores and websites going on and those that make the argument that you need to check for id in the bookstores, why not online, are doing so in bad faith.If my web server is in another state and I have no nexus in Texas, why should I have to comply with an out of state law?  It's not as if I'm compelling individuals to access my web server.What's porn and what's not is also an issue.  If I were to preface all videos shown with quotes from Shakespeare, would I still have to check ID?  It's a hypothetical, but there are a million other hypotheticals one can come up with in regards to this idiotic law."

      "body": "I think under current precedent, the Texas law is arguably unconstitutional. But it is distinctly different than the previous law that Congress had passed. It is more narrowly tailored and doesn't have the vagueness issues. So the court could rule that this law passes strict scrutiny while the other doesn't. I do think the 5th Circuit going with rational basis isn't going to be what SCOTUS does."

      "body": "How they decide is ultimately an empirical question. My view is that obscenity doesn't enjoy 1A protection and that therefore these ID requirements are likely kosher and will stand.My view is also that it's stupid to regulate something like this at the State level and that Congress would be fully within their authority to do so Federally. But a law being stupid isn't the same as a law being unconstitutional, so this will be for Congress, not SCOTUS to fix."

      "body": "We see only one answer and therefore only one way to read Ashcroft II consistently with Ginsberg: Ashcroft II did not rule on the appropriate tier of scrutiny for COPA.  It merely ruled on the issue the parties presented: whether COPA would survive strict scrutiny.  Indeed, the petitioner’s brief in Ashcroft II made two claims:...In other words, the petitioners did not challenge the applicable standard of review. Because that is not a jurisdictional argument, the Court did not have to correct them sua sponte.There are 3 levels if scrutiny when the courts look at a violation of constitutional rights: rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny. Those range first to last, easy to hard.They're subjective and you can't really reduce it to math but rational basis generally means the government wins unless what they're doing is insanely stupid and or hateful. Strict scrutiny means the government is going to have a heck of a time proving that it's incredibly important they have this law and there's no other way they can accomplish their important goal they wrote it for.Aschroft lead the lower court and those who agree with the ACLU and others that this case should hinge on strict scrutiny - meaning Texas should be held to an incredibly high standard when explaining why this law is incredibly important and there isn't any less restrictive way for them to do it.The 5th circuit disagrees and think they should use rational basis - which is only technically not the same as saying Texas wins good bye. Rational basis is generally that easy.What's weird about that decision and has the aclu and others upset is that the Fifth Circuit decided that the supreme court in ashcroft used the wrong kind of review. This is very strange because the lower court had absolutely no authority to tell the supreme court they're wrong on a matter of law. They try to get out of this insane departure from the law by saying the supreme court wasn't technically wrong, they just weren't technically required to use the right standard because the appelant didn't ask them to.The 5th circuit is infamous for crazy cases like this that completely ignore precedent and do unpredictable things like this - it's part of why you see Texas involved in high profile cases so much.As for scotus, they aren't required and often don't comment when they turn down injunctions like the one requested here. It likely means a majority of the court is at least moderately curious about this law being constitutional and agreeing with the Fifth Circuit.More pessimistic court watchers would likely tell you that this court is very conservative and is intentionally letting the law stand despite knowing it isn't constitutional for political reasons - like Texas abortion bounty hunter law that got a bunch of buzz prior to the Dobbs decision overturning Roe.It may be a sign they're going to overturn ascroft, or in my opinion they'll do a trick this court likes to do sometimes where they pretend they aren't overturning it while making a ruling inconsistent with the decision - similar to how the 5th circuit basically overruled the supreme court but said technically they didn't despite it being obvious the results sure look like they did."
