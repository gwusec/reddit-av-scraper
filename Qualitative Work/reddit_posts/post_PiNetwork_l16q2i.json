  "body": "As the title says. Is there a way to know what information is sent by Yoti? Does pi network only require to validate you as a real human or does it request other sensitive information saved on Yoti.\n\nIf it's the former then it would be OK, but if it's the latter it exposes personal information and I'm not sold on it.\n\nDid someone pass KYC and could enlighten me on the matter?",
