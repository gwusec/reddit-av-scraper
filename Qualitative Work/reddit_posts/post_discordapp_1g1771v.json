I use Discord to follow gaming communities, but I can't figure, but I don't know how it knows my age. Is there any way to check it or even change my age?",

So it makes sense they got your age from there.However, from what I read, Discord doesn't store your birthdate. They only need it to determine whether you're under/above 18 and you can view NSFW server or not"
