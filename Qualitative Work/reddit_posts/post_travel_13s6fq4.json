  "body": "Edit: I called support, they navigated me to alternative verification page that worked\n\nI have booked a flight from Vienna to Palma-Majorka via Kiwi. Few days later, an email comes from Kiwi that I need to\n\n\"Complete your ID verification and check in online with Ryanair\"\n\nand that\n\n\"Ryanair has introduced a new ID verification requirement that travelers must complete themselves before the check-in process. \"\n\nbut when I go to the Ryanair verification page, which points me to this linkhttps://onlineform.ryanair.com/en/en/customer-verification\n\nI enter basic details, then it prompts me to log in or sign up (there is no other option). When I click any of those, it throws me back to Ryanair page and throws 404 error\n\nI have tried to do this for 2 days now, same issue\n\nI have tried several browsers, same issue\n\nPlease, can anybody help? Have somebody encountered the same issue?\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/it3lls9l662b1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1382c47f44efcb114856a44808e238b9614792d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m6lqrmuq662b1.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f5c7120f26cfcc1ebe16117fa2a4c44571d3172e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yy2wu2y662b1.png?width=2893&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ac82f62d794c0d82200f5ef5f7bb019a0a4a8f57",

I had booked with Last Minute for Ryanair flights, and during the referral check-in, I was hit with the Ryanair verification page. It turned out to be because of the way they formatted the names. Here's how to find out what is correct:On your last minute \"Remember to check in for your xxx\" email, find their generated email looks something likejohn7@leo.doe(dot)bookingease(dot)xxxCopy it from that email. exampleFirst name and surname: John LoeLast: doeMine had spaces instead of hyphens, etc.I hope this helped."
