  "body": "I have a temporary drivers licebse as my wallet was stolen a week ago. The temporary drivers license is a peice of paper and is not recognized by the scan system. I tried contacting support but they said they cant do anything. My new drivers license will come in 4-6 weeks. Is there anything I can do?\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: I wanted to update the post in case anyone else looks this up. I contacted support through email, the app, and twitter and a temporary drivers license is seen as invalid in instacart's eyes. Only a permanent ID can be used for verification. So looks like I won't be using instacart for the next month",

      "body": "I have never seen a gig app allow you to bypass identification.  The thing is everyone can say they don't have a scannable license forreasonsand if instacart allowed exceptions then they're just creating a way to bypass identification.  Most systems aren't even set up with a way to turn the identification requirement off, because it's a hard requirement.  So you can ask, but I'd be shocked if it happened.Edit: totally misread that OPs wallet was stolen."

I have the paper copy but was told it's not accepted. I asked for a number to speak with someone else and was told they didn't have one. I don't understand how the state considereds something a valid ID but 1 single company doesn't."
