  "body": "Does anyone else experiences this? whenever I’m speaking to someone on bumble, tinder hinge etc it happens me so frequently (I’m identify verified on all apps) I (20 F) will be speaking to someone, they’ll ask do I have Snapchat or instagram. My reply is always the same ‘I have both, but I barley use them as I’m not big into social media’ they normally say that it’s no problem and give me their number or social handle.  However when speaking to them they’ll snidely make remarks about how it’s ‘strange for a young woman to not use social media’ ‘very strange to have nothing posted or following little to no people’ (I only follow my family and prefer to keep things private and it’s just my preference not to post anything). Or they’ll bring up the fact I don’t drink alcohol which is on my profile. And I get passive aggressively spoken to for my choices and have them labelled as ‘strange for your age’ But they’ll demand I video call, send a verification video/selfie, to prove I’m real. I understand you can never be too sure in this day and age but for some reason it always really frustrates me when they ask as if I’ve something to prove. And every single time it happens I just lose interest instantly because of how interrogated and judged I feel. I understand they don’t know if I’m telling the truth or not …but I’m verified, I’d gladly call after we get to know each other and would rather meet for a date than have a penpal anyway, but when it’s so pressurised and aggressively put across during the first conversation!!!! it makes me not want to prove anything at all! Just had to get my rant out as it’s so frustrating. There’s nothing about my profile I’d flag as ‘possible catfish’ vibes. Does anyone have any tips for this, or have experienced the same thing?",

      "body": "You have nothing to prove to those jerks; you're already verified.The only reason they're hassling you like that is you're a young woman and they think that they can bully you. They're also pissed that you don't drink alcohol (it probably makes them feel judged and insecure if they do) and you have the nerve to not have sexy pictures and videos on social media! How are they supposed to get off and send you unasked for dick pics now?Just block and delete. The trash is taking itself out.(And don't contact men outside of the app. No bueno.)"

Keep doing that. Not every match will be a fairy tale. They will, unless you're very lucky, for the most part do something that makes one or both of you lose interest. This is dating. This is normal. Whats important is remembering your needs are valid and if you feel they are not meeting them then you're under no obligation to keep talking to them. Unmatch."

Are you matching with people a lot older than you? If so, they might just not believe you’re real because most of their other matches with people your age have been cat fishes."
