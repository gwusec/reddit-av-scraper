      "body": "So, laws like the one that just went into effect in Florida have been passed in several states here in the US. The laws require age verification via official government IDs (driver's license, passport, etc). Pornhub thinks that's a huge breech of privacy and a gateway tofurther breeches of personal privacy, so they're simply cutting access to their site in states that pass these laws.Which is probably just fine to the lawmakers, because the laws are simply a result of American mainstream culture being extremely prudish."
