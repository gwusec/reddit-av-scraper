  "body": "My husband and I are getting started. I‚Äôve been absorbing every bit of advice on this page for weeks and got made two accounts under my name. One for a free account and one for a paid account. They both got verified & release forms were submitted for my husband on each.\n\nA few days later I got the posted email saying my release form link has expired and needs to be resubmitted. The next email said the account was deactivated:\n\n‚ÄúFollowing a manual review, your account has been deactivated because it violated our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines for the reason(s) below:\n\nfeaturing, tagging, or referencing someone whose age, identity or consent is not verified‚Äù\n\nI hadn‚Äôt posted even posted anything yet - had just put a solo picture up & written out bios. And the release form was submitted days prior with the verification.\n\nFrom what I understand he doesn‚Äôt HAVE to have his own account. And the only reason I was trying to avoid that was because I had to enter my social media info despite it saying ‚Äúoptional‚Äù.\n\nDid I miss a step? Is this because I put fake names in our bio? Is that allowed? Does he have to have an account? Is there some way to bypass the social media step during verification?\n\nI have no intention of quitting no matter how frustrating this is so any help is greatly appreciated.",

If he‚Äôs worried about people finding his page, just make his account faceless, a picture of his chest or something"

We had to set up a separate account for her and she had to set up an IG and post a few pictures for verification. Every time we post I tag another creator. Every picture, every message, everything.
