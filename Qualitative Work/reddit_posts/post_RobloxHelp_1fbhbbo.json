  "body": "Okay, so today I was playing a Roblox game and this guy asked me if I had VC, and I told him no, since I didnâ€™t bother with trying to enable it due to the fact I donâ€™t like using my voice to talk. Later on I was a little curious to see how to enable it (I wasnâ€™t going to anyway) and I just realized I had my account set to the wrong age (8 years old) despite me making my account when I was actually 8. Iâ€™m 18 now, almost about to be 19 in a few more weeks and I genuinely want to change the age on my account so itâ€™s more accurate. Any help on how to reach out for support and what to say in order for them to have my age changed?",

      "body": "This happened to my friend, he was messing around and set his age back 8 years. Roblox refused to do anything. If you really want to try to fix it, and iâ€™d see why, they might have a support line, iâ€™d recommend calling them rather than email, as the emails are most of the time automated, even when they say it was a human response.Edit: Just remembered that when your account turn 13, you can change the age to whatever, but thatâ€™s still in 5 years for your account so RIP"
