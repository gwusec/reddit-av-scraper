  "body": "We’re currently managing an adult website and want to ensure we’re fully compliant with all legal requirements, particularly when it comes to 18 U.S.C. § 2257 regulations for image documentation. Staying on top of age verification and content restrictions can be challenging, especially as regulations seem to evolve frequently. We’ve been considering using services likeCompliantPixto help manage this, but we’re looking for advice from others in the industry. How do you handle compliance, especially with 2257 regulations? Any tips for staying updated and avoiding legal pitfalls?",
