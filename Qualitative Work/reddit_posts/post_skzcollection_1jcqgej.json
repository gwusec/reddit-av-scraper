Recommendations on where to buy, trustworthy websites and sources, things like that! This might be a bit vague but I don‚Äôt have any specific areas that I‚Äôm looking into so I just want some overall advice & help! ü•∞ü´∂\n\nEverything in the photo is what I currently have (and as seen I literally only have one album and two non-official pieces haha)",

      "body": "I buy all my albums on Amazon or get them at Target and as for Skzoo or merch I usually buy from Jyp shop. I will also buy from ebay and mercari too sometimes, but I usually buy from the same sellers each time cause I like to go by how much sellers have sold, how many followers they have and by their ratings and the ones I have bought from I know to trust."

      "body": "You have multiple options.If you want to buy easily, you can buy from target or Amazon or any K-pop store in your country/city.If you don't have a K-pop store accessible to you or want to save some money you can find a go (group order) and buy with more people, that way you save up like 30-40% more than if you buy from a store (but the wait is way longer).If you want to buy a lot of merch that is only from korea/Japan, or merch that is older/harder to find you can look up for a proxy, it can be on the Philippines, korea or Japan, they can buy things for you from a seller in that country or when they have events like a pop-up store or fanmeetings, and they ship all that you buyed directly to you.If you don't care to open a brand new album and are looking for specific things you can look wts (want to sell) groups in your area or on Instagram or Twitter (X) and buy the merch second hand, a lot of people do this and save a little money too.If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask^"

      "body": "If you are willing to buy in bulk, the price per album is pretty decent after like 6+ (like ~$18 per album including shipping) on cokodive and kpopalbums.com, I got most of my collection from those two in bulk and filled in any gaps with subkshopIf you want any Japan albums, Mercari Japan using a proxy was the least expensive option in my opinion but some other sites sell the Japanese albumsAnd if you don‚Äôt mind secondhand,r/kpopforsaleand mercari are good places"
