  "body": "Italian user here. When I try to create an account, I'm always asked to verify my age because italian users have to. Long story short, age verification doesn't seem to work and after some times accounts get disabled anyway. Is there a way to create a normal account? There is a thread about it, but there is no solution in that thread.",
