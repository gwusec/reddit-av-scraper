  "body": "sooo I have had musical.ly/tiktok on my phone since 2016 and I first downloaded it when I was below the age of 13, but I have had it ever since and I never had any issues with age restrictions. I am now above the age of 18 so my days of changing my birth year to sign up for websites are behind me, but I went to send a message to my friend on TikTok and was told ‚ÄúDue to multiple community guidelines violations, you‚Äôre temporarily prevented from sending and receiving messages.‚Äù I was SUPER confused by this because I have never violated any community guidelines on this app and this came out of absolutely nowhere. I clicked on the thing that said learn more and it told me that I was blocked from messaging because I was below the age of 16. I clicked the appeal button and it gives you the option to either take a selfie of yourself holding your ID up, or give them your credit card information so they can take out a small charge then refund it. I personally haven‚Äôt ever seen a social media platform or any other website ask for someone to send a picture of themselves holding up their ID, and I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it. I just put an empty visa gift card into the credit card thing and it worked perfectly fine. It wasn‚Äôt that big of an issue to resolve, but I‚Äôm just annoyed that it happened in the first place + if I really was under the proper age needed to be able to send messages or whatever it is,  it‚Äôs super easy to bypass. I‚Äôd also prefer if it didn‚Äôt tell me that I had violated community guidelines when I hadn‚Äôt. Just a big mess and super annoying and disrespectful in a way Lol. Hopefully this post can help some random person out if this happens to them.",
