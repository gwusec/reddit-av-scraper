Plus it's a very good update for creeps who are already sus around kids to identify who's a minor (if you think what I said is vulgar then I know your game better than you) I have seen this app become discord over the years for exact reason you are thinking.I am telling this for like the thousandth time just make it a PAID app LKWD or whoever is incharge yall are not slick with free app with in-app purchases thing üòÇ well idc now.
