  "body": "Hey there. Just got NordVPN, trying to unblock some videos I haven't been able to watch thanks to the EU regulations. Since I don't plan on uploading my freakn ID to verify my age, I hoped that a VPN would to the trick.\n\nSo far, no success though. I tried restarting my PC, reconnecting to several other servers, using a different browser, deleting my cookies...nothing. Youtube still asks me for my age. Is there anything else I can do? Do I need to make a new google account?",
