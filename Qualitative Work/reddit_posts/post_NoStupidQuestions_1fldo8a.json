  "body": "Hi. So i want to install discord on my phone but i need to verify my age for some reason. I switched to an account that has been registered as of age from the start but it still wants me to verify it, and when i open the link it automatically opens it with an account with age not yet verified. I don't have the nerves for the selfie/id/etc thing for an old account and i just want discord. Additionally, both discord and reddit are marked 18+ on play market but i downloaded reddit without problem, so i don't know what the problem is. Thanks for your attention.\n\nedit: i took the jimmy urine cube i made earlier today and did the selfie thing. it helped",
