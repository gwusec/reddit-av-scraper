  "body": "I had a dominant on twitter get real mad at me for asking for age verification and I had to block her. She got nasty over me just asking if she had an only fans or something. I feel weird asking for an ID.\n\nI worry that tiktok is bringing a flood of underage women and i don't want to accidentally send money to a teenager.\n\nHow are other subs dealing with age verifying?",

Yeah, the ID thing its not a thing as its weird to spread your Id over the internet but if the domme has an age verified site its easy to check up. I wouldnt reccomend you to approach persons that dont have any of those because you either are going to deal with a scammer or an underage person."
