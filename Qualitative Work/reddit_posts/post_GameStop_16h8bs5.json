  "title": "We have to check ID regardless if you look old or not. Do not get mad please‚Ä¶",
  "body": "Long explanation but the summary of it is that at our location we are required to always check ID even if they are of age because of two main reason. Our location; being in a busy shopping center and past issues we have had; specifically children not telling their parents what the game is. Now idk if it‚Äôs the same for every district or every store (probably not) but that is what we we are told to do.\n\nNow I myself always found this ‚Äúnew change‚Äù odd and a bit exaggerating to say the least but after my manager and my DM spoken to us the team about it and why we push for this policy from here on out I guess in the end it all make sense. Tbh I don‚Äôt mind it and don‚Äôt care much about it, as long as we make the sale it‚Äôs all good. Now we been doing this ever since the year before Covid, since holiday season I will say and I guess I was dumb enough to hope that people will understand. But nope 9/10 times I been yelled at by guests as to why I need to check ID.\n\nI would calmly explain to them why and what the rating system is but they would say along the lines of ‚Äúbut I played ___‚Äù or ‚Äúis just blood and gore‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt I look old enough? im literally ___ years old‚Äù Sorry but I am told to check id regardless.\n\nReason why I share this is because a guy came in looking for black ops 3 looked about 30 ish or so years, asked for his ID and he lost it when I said I can‚Äôt ring him up for it unfortunately. He almost was about to yell at me until I told him ‚Äúim really sorry but I‚Äôm following procedures that my DM is telling me‚Ä¶‚Äú he ofc calmed down but still called me a b*tch and walked off. Which I have already gone use to myself and I don‚Äôt mind if I am thrown insults at once and while. But I ask that guests don‚Äôt do it to none of my other coworkers, they are all doing the same procedures I am doing.",

      "body": "When I was still a holiday hire, my store manager was very strict about ID‚Äôing for M rated games. I was working with him and my assistant manager this shift.A woman, clearly in her 80‚Äôs, was buying World at War for her grandson for Christmas. I went through the ‚Äúblood, violence, gore, etc‚Äù disclaimer and skipped the pos prompt for ID. My manager steps over and whispers ‚ÄúID‚Äù to me, so I ask for her ID, and she bursted out laughing, causing me and the assistant manager to burst out laughing. In his embarrassment, the SM retired to his desk in the back with a ‚Äúvery well hidden‚Äù flask of whiskey he emptied into his coffee.After SM went to the back the woman said something to the effect of ‚Äúdoes your manager know that the next time I‚Äôll get id‚Äôd is when my family visits me in the morgue.‚Äù She, her daughter, and her grandson were regulars, I later found out.I guess the situation made such an impression on her that she‚Äôs hand over her license even when buying E rated titles just to fuck with me.This was 2008-2009 so I have my doubts she‚Äôs still alive, but I‚Äôll never forget her, even as a complete stranger"

Not one of my most smartest moments cause it was a heated situation at a fucking bank, but I wasn‚Äôt going to have a teller, who was being nice as hell, just get fucking dragged because this old ass man didn‚Äôt take his license with him despite him fucking driving there. We joked about it after the fact."
