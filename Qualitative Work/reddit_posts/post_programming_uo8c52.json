      "body": "The EU wants websites to implement verification of age and identity by 2024, possibly using an as yet to be developed digital ID.Websites deemed to serve harmful content will have to verify their visitors identity before letting them continue. The EU says this is to protect children online, but at the same time it will strip away any remaining anonimity a user might have left. Porn websites will be required to use this new system, as will other websites deemed to serve harmful content."

      "body": "Why do they keep lobbying for this. Every few years there's a bill that basically amounts to this. It saps peoples personal freedoms and anonymity in the interest of blocking people from content they should already be restricted from. News flash, if you're worried your kids are watching porn... don't give them free access to the Internet and actually do your job as a parent. It's the same BS with parents basically refusing to have the sex talk, ever. And then just demanding schools do all of it for them, but not until the child is at an age every parent agrees is old enough (which none of them do)."

It is non binding for the states, voluntary for the companies and in no way is anything decided. In short: the only thing this promises is tax payer money going to some research firm to then be ignored. Like always."
