  "body": "Hello all, please let me give you a quick intro: I am looking into doing a little cam work from time to time. Nothing major and it definately will not be my main occupation. I have a very strong latex kink and I intend to wear full body coverage including a mask any time I show myself.\n\nAll the sites do age verification, which is a good thing. However for example Chaturbate does give your age verification data (selfie, ID, ...) to a company named Incode Technologies, Inc. They also reserve the right to involve other, unnamed companies.\n\nNow on to my question: Is there any site that will do the age verification without sending my data to (multiple) third parties?\n\nThank you, Marlene",
