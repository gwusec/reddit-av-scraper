This state is obsessed with inserting its unclean fingers into our bedrooms, sexuality, reproductive rights, and gender. It's exhausting, dumb, costs taxpayer money (of course this law will be challenged in court), andcreepy. Like shut the fuck up about libraries, porn, abortions, and trans people. Fix the roads. Improve flood protection. Improve education. It's absurd how hard our legislators work to avoid doing any real work."
