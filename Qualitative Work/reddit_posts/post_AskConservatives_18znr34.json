  "body": "I feel like we‚Äôre mostly all going to agree it‚Äôs insanity and massive invasion of privacy. (Granted, we‚Äôre also Reddit people though so slightly more ‚Äúliberal‚Äù and exposed to more online than the average non-internet conservative even if we hold the same view points in reality. Just my own thoughts.)\n\nBut why is it mostly red states that are introducing this legislation? There‚Äôs no way that it‚Äôll actually protect children from finding it.\n\nOn the other hand, I read something from an ex-porn addict who supported it because it turned him into someone that only viewed women as objects and was unable to see their value as friends and people. So I get that.\n\nBut as we all know, banning something doesn‚Äôt solve the issue.\n\nThoughts?",

      "body": "I think modern Internet porn is a serious public health problem. Specifically, the combination of the normalization of extreme sadomasochistic-ish content, or content seeming to depict rape and violent misogyny, along with the tendency for someone to watch alotof porn all at once and jump from video to video.I am skeptical as to whether those laws are a good, effective, Constitutional, or viable method of solving the problem."
