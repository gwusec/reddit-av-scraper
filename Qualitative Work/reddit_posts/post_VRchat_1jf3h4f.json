  "body": "This is my first group that I've been considering making for a while.Here is the link, it's invite only for now, as I'll be manually checking that everyone requesting is Age Verified 18+.https://vrc.group/AOD.1951Let me know if you have any questions, concerns or suggestions. The group banner and icon are subject to be updated to something better.\n\nI do have a small optimized world , that I plan to customize for group only access since it will be an adult only world.",

      "body": "Yeah. And their excuse is always the same: \"Oh kids fake it so we still need to see your ID.\"Despite the fact that faking an age verification is actually VERY hard to do. Even the most technologically inept parent would have second thoughts of having to have their ID pictures, then taking profile shots of yourself to make sure the face actually matches the ID.As you said. It's nothing more than a power trip for those guys."

I want to make group public instances eventually to get the group out there but until then we wonâ€™t be using a bouncer or asking for any personal information just to get in. The goal of this group is to enjoy VRChat using the systems it has in place and create a frictionless experience as possible."
