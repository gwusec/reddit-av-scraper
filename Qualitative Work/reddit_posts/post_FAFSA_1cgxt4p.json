Students and contributors without an SSN must continue to manually enter their tax information. Students without an SSN must verify their eligible noncitizen status through their school before they receive any federal funds.\n\nhttps://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-center/library/electronic-announcements/2024-04-30/update-access-2024-25-fafsa-form-individuals-without-social-security-number\n\nContributors without an SSN will not have to wait to have their identity validation completed before they can use their account username and password to access and complete the online 2024-25 FAFSA form.\n\nUpdate: It youâ€™re having issues with parent not getting the invite from you, please refer to a comment I have made on this post.",
