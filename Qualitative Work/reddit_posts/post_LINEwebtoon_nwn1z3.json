I just realized my WT account is linked to FB and tried to make a new account on PC so that I can resubscribe to my favorite webtoons. As it says in the title, every time I go to WT's website and click \"sign up,\" it just redirects me to the same age verification bs. Yes, I've entered my age, cleared my cookies, reloaded the page, and cleared my chrome of anything that has to do with webtoon. No luck at all.",

This left me on the sign-up sheet, which works just fine without age verification. After I'd signed up, I got the age verification thing again when I logged in, but it actually went away after filling it out."
