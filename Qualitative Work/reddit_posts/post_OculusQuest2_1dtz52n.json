  "body": "I got an email a few days ago saying my account hasn't completed age verification and will be disabled in a week or so.\n\nFair enough - so went through the required steps, did the cc payment age verification and moved on to the stage when it asks for the code being displayed on the device:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/QA430uL.png\n\nOnly trouble is, I did the verification on my PC (as that's where I saw the email) and I think at the time my occulus was turned off. When I turned it on there was no code being displayed anywhere!\n\nI've restarted the occulus a few times and poked around the settings menu in there. The only thing I've been able to find is a copy of the original notification saying the account will soon be deactivated.\n\nThe meta page asking for the code doesn't seem to have a way to resend the code - I've stepped back in the process a few times and forward to see if this will retrigger the code to show up, but no luck so far.\n\nIn shear desperation, I've even resorted to pressing the \"Need Help\" button and opened a ticket with meta directly - with some predictable (lack-of) results. Every support message/reply seems to have a 2 day turn around at best, and currently they have gone radio silent.  At this rate I'm going to run out of time before they come back with further questions.\n\nHas any one else run into this issue?\n\nAny suggestions on how I can get the code to retrigger?",
