  "body": "I asked this in the FinDom support group too but I wanted a subâ€™s perspective.\n\nDo you age verify? If yes, how do you verify in a way that doesnâ€™t feel like an invasion of privacy? (I understand sending an ID can be scary, so I try to offer options like having an account on LF)\n\nIf no, is privacy the main concern? Do you have trouble finding a domme to interact with that doesnâ€™t require AV?",
