However when I try to transfer my balance it says activity not allowed and to verify with an ID however, I donâ€™t have an ID is there a way to get around this and get my money or do I need to have an ID or drivers license to get the money out of Mercari",

Most people 18 and up have something, driver license, state ID, passport, military ID, etc. if you are under age, you are screwed. You wonâ€™t get that money because you have to be over 18 to sell on Mercari & have ID to make the deposits & get tax info sent to you"

      "body": "If you don't have the money to get a temporary driver's license (not every state has them but in mine you can get at 16 years old and you have to take a test on the bmv computers) you can see if your state has free state ID's. It's not a driver's license but it is a good alternative if you don't drive. I think in Ohio they're issued for either 5 to 10 years or 4 to 8 years. It's been a minute since I looked at the website."
