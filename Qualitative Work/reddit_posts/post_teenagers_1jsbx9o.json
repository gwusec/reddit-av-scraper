  "body": "13- you think u are a teenager, but you really arent, you are just a slightly more mature version of ur 12 year old self. You are 12 and only 12 you also say u are \"technically a teen\" and will protect that claim with ur life. But there are a small percentage where you guys are chill and mature\n\n14- you are officially a teen and people will now think you are mature and stuff. I cant think of anything insulting, so frick you. From what ive seen yall watch a lot of jjba (respect)\n\n15- ngl ur like the middle child. People either think ur 14 or 16, no one really notices.\n\n16- this is where you are actually recognized as a human member of society. You dont have time to do anything cuz you are flipping patties for minimum wage\n\n17- ngl u guys are chill, but yall are hella nervous about ur future. So stop being a discord mod and do something productive instead of commenting on a post that came out -6 seconds ago\n\n18- certified unc status (looks like my phone bouta die, the life support is in the way)\n\n19- i respect yall. You are like the sensei wu of this sub. You give out advice even though ur as old as ancient china.\n\n20- \" \"\n\n30+ yall are either pedos or try to save this subreddit like batman or somethting\n\nOk so some people dont understand the fact that i meant 13 year olds being 12 not literally but maturely. Most 13 year olds from my experience are childish",
