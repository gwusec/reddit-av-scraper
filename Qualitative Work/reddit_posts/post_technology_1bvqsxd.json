South Carolina has a bill in their legislation too.  It feels like a variation of this type of bill is making its way through a lot of states. I wouldn't be surprised if it's being pushed by the same organization."

At no cost (outside setup and hardware).You don't even have to setup hardware and setup stuff, there is free DNS services you can just plop the IP into the devices, and you're good to go. Just pick the IP of the DNS that does adult filtering.Or better yet, teach kids the natural bits about life, and stop hiding it like it's the devil."

For some reason parents give their kids unfiltered unsupervised access to the internet and are then sho led to learn they don't just use it for homework. They are also screeching for government intervention when the truth is most devices have this filtering capability already."
