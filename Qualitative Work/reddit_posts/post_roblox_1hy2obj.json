It's so stupid, I couldn't even get through with my own identification card that's how ridiculous it is. School cards I think would be better if they're gonna make voice chat13+since usually High Schoolers are 13+ (at least where I live).",

They can't verify a school ID without manually contacting the school it belongs to.Voicechat was also originally only an 18+ features which (in my opinion) worked better since it didn't require the moderation algorithms we have now that are prone to false positives"
