As a Yoti-verified applicant, you will be invited on a rolling basis to a special Pi KYC verification process in the Pi KYC app on the Pi Browser to complete any missing data and checks\n\nBut I have no idea what additional Pi KYC application is, the KYC screen in the browser says ‘Applied, and has done for years.\n\nNo mention of Yoti anywhere in FAQ or other documents",

You're one of them.But yoti is just not suitable for pinetwork requirement so they build their own kyc app.And you have to redo kyc. So, do kyc or else your coins will not be migrated and you lost huge portion of it if its too late."
