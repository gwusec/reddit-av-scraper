A new porn site ahead of the database, Twitter, a new nsfw Reddit, endless choices.It‚Äôs like ants at a picnic.It‚Äôs gonna happen. His entire world is about seeing boobs or more. Short of putting him on an Amish farm, nothing is gonna stop the hunger.I have 2 daughters. My psychologist wife informs me girls look at porn too, it‚Äôs just something you gotta deal with via good parenting and yes,if she‚Äôs asking you to get on the pill, that means ‚Äúmom I‚Äôm already fucking my boyfriend I haven‚Äôt told you much about, and I want to be safe so you‚Äôre not a 44 year old grandma.‚ÄùDon‚Äôt depend on her young and dumb boyfriend to properly use condoms either assuming he even buys them. That‚Äôs a snowballs chance in hell.These righties who think their son or daughter is a good kid (because the kid would rather die than tell their uptight parents that they‚Äôre screwing) are the ones with the kids having the most unprotected sex."

End of story.Absolutally correct, but more than that, these efforts to block major websites only makes things less safe for kids.First it pushes kids to shadier foreign websites. Yes major companies like pornhub will block a whole state, but I bet mrhardcore.porno.cx or something won't. Who knows what weird shit is on those pages. If it isn't hard core fetish material, it could also be viruses or crypto miners.Second, it could also encourage kids to use alternative tech. VPNs work well, but most reputable ones cost money. The free ones with no size limit are usually sketchy af. At best they're mining your data. You could use tor, but do you really want a teenager looking at porn on tor? Ugh! You could go back to torrenting porn like we did with BearShare in the early 00s, but how many times are the downloaded videos mislabeled (somethings horrific things) or viruses?This bullshit literally makes thingsless safe for kids, while also violating the privacy of adults. Lose / lose."

      "body": "I don't think it's possible to stop kids from finding porn if they want to see it. End of story.I further think this law causes significant online privacy problems because verification requires that you send pictures of your face for AI scanning (no issues with that whatsoever) or sensitive ID documents. It's like the dream scenario for identity thieves.I also don't like the law because it's another one of those dumb \"random citizens can sue a person or company over this law if they want to because it would be illegal for the government to do this\" laws that pretty much ignore all logic, the US constitution, and any sort of objectivity just so that they can avoid the government doing stuff. Democrats really need to pass a law like this in California or New York saying \"if anyone owns a gun, any other citizen can sue them for $10000 for endangering their safety\" so that this nonsense gets declared unconstitutional."

You can shut down every porn company in the world and people will make their own.They've just made it difficult for children to access it.I guarantee they haven't. They've probably made it more annoying for older people to access it since they are less tech savvy.This is one of those things you don't allow in your presence as an adult, but stop wasting your time trying to fight an unwinnable battle."

      "body": "Alrighty.I used to be in the camp of \"I dont really care, spunds like a dumb law, but whatever, I'm an adult, it won't effect me\"Then ID based age verification was implemented on VA, and porn sites got divided into two-groups:A) major sites with the resources to implement this policy and the official infrastructure to be held responsible.B) Small sites without those resources or sites already shady enough to be designed for it to be difficult to hold them responsible.Before this new law, A were sites that could and would put effort into keeping illegal content off their site, who would have actual advertisers rather than malware ads, and who could the smallest modicum of effort into seeing performers were treated well.B were sites where you could easily pick up malware, find revenge porn, etc.  Or worse.Now?  Group A complies with the law, requiring ID verification, and B doesn't.  A loses a ton of traffic from people who dont want to hand their ID to a porn company, people who dont consume enough to go through the hassle, and.... people who dont have over 18 IDs.  All of that traffic, 100%, goes to group B.These laws benefit shady companies who prey on performers, risk the safety of their customers, and proliferate illegal content."
