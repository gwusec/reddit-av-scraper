      "body": "The timing of this is quite notable. Apple notified a small segment of its users yesterday who it believes were targeted by a‚Äúmercenary spyware attack‚Äù. It seems after these notices going out started being reported on by news media, thousands of accounts received the popup OP is describing (including my own).I am really hoping it isn‚Äôt related at all but it would be a pretty odd coincidence‚Ä¶ To me it looks like there may have been a priority list of targets and once the media picked up this story, whoever is controlling and using the software hit whatever accounts remained that were lower priorities immediately after they became aware Apple was able to detect their attacks."

That co-worker hasn't even held this phone, since I upgraded my phone a few years after they quit.I reached out in one of the Slack communities I'm a part of, and someone told me they saw something similar but with a test account they use for development. A few people on Twitter have also posted about this in the past few hours.I'm not sure what's going on, but I assume there's nothing to worry about and that something weird is just going on with Apple IDs."

Then, when the app needs to update, it will require that Apple ID to sign in to verify the update since the primary account did not install the app.Not saying thats what happened in this case, but that is a scenario I have seen this kind of popup."
