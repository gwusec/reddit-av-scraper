  "body": "I live in Germany. If you order any media with the age rating 18/adult, they ship it with age verification needed. And that's lovely. Not.\n\nIm at work, I'm not home at the time the package arrived. But my dad was. So I left my ID and a permission slip, so he could accept the package in my name. Nope. Doesn't work. It needs to be given to me directly. I could pick it up at my closest post office tomorrow around lunch time. But guess what, right, I'll be at work. Friday is a holiday. So earliest I can get it is Saturday morning. And it's honestly annoying. There had been delivery people before, giving my orders to my parents, accepting the ID and slip. Not anymore, I guess. And I can't help but grumble how annoying that is",
