Access porn, order and sell things online, even criminal hacking, sell illegal drugs. Near me years ago a kid your child's age was selling illegal fireworks out of a shed through Facebook Marketplace."

The seller has committed a crime.  In fact, you can't even purchase and receive a vape through the mail without an adult signature upon delivery.Now, if what your so n actually purchased was an oxygen inhaler that looks like a vape, which is what I see for sale on eBay, that is legal and is not a vape and cannot be used to vape anything."
