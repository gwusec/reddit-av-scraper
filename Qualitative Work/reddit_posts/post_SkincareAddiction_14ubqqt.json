  "body": "In the last few days, the filter has blown up. I have seen people who look incredible and barely changes but I look like a 90-year-old women who sunbathed and smoked. I‚Äôm 17, have worn sunscreen everyday since I was 13, and recently started retinol. I have also avoided making exaggerated facial expressions (like raising my eyebrows). Now I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll end up looking like the filter no matter what. So tell me, is it accurate?",

There‚Äôs nothing to be scared of, you‚Äôve likely lived long enough to realize life is not all about looks"

Be happy/sad/worried, etc.  These comments from young people make me sad.  I‚Äôm not judging, please know‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs sad to hear individuals change facial expressions, how they sleep, etc to avoid a natural process. Of course, eat decently, don‚Äôt smoke, avoid sun bathing‚Ä¶. Moderate alcohol.  Take decent care of your skin‚Ä¶.It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶. A bit disheartening at times.  Especially in the very young‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre all beautiful and have lovely, elastic skin!  Enjoy it.Worry about the rest when you‚Äôre older and truly seeing changes."

      "body": "I hope not. Im early 20s and have done it with my friends, and they look 40ish, while I literally look 90I‚Äôm not putting too much stock into it. It‚Äôs just a random filter, and I have pronounced cheekbones that I think it really picks up to give me a gaunt look. Regardless, don‚Äôt stress over it. I quit using the filter so as not to trigger me lol, as I get bad anxiety over aging.If it helps in general, I read a quote recently that said something alone the lines of ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing sadder than wasting youth by trying to run away from aging‚ÄùWe‚Äôre young now (especially you, 17 is so much younger than you even realize) so just enjoy being young and take the regular precautions. If we‚Äôre fortunate, we‚Äôre gonna age regardless, might as well savor our youth for now and live in the moment"

      "body": "funny thing is I have very pronounced cheekbones but it makes my face sag so much and look fat. It's so bizarre. It really picks up on some of the lines you have on your face. Some lines I've had since I was young and has been the same for a long time - filter just uses that and exaggerates it."

I just feel like shit about it and honestly not sure how to cope without feeling like i'm lying to myself"
