  "body": "Recently tried to do the age Verification and it failed. I tried doing it through my ID and that also failed as my ID is different for people under 21. I contacted Yoti and they told me to contact Avakin life, and I did. I'm 19 and I have a drivers license and a security card, as I work as a Security guard. I already paid for it so I was wondering who would I talk to to get this fixed or did Avakin life just take my money?",

      "body": "Hi. Exactly the same happened to me. I'm 29. It didn't tell me I looked under 18. It just told me the verification failed. I think the photo capture was too blurry. Same with my passport capture. I contacted avakin support. Here's their answer: for those of us who fail to verify we have to wait 30 days before we can try againI have another question: did you try several attempts? If so did it charge you on each attempt? I tried just 1 attempt with photo capture and a attempt with my passport"
