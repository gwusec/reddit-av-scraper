  "body": "Hey, because of some new rules here in the EU, platforms need to make sure that 18+ videos are only watched by people above 18 and youtube forces me to send an image of my ID as a prove. I am above 18 and also have the correct year of birth on my google Account but because I'm a bit concerned about online privacy and data protection, I won't send my ID anywhere, especially not to Google. I don't know if this would be possible but it would be cool and a step in the right direction in terms of online privacy.\n\nEdit: for everyone with the same problem,u/seplaso1recommended trying NewPipe and it does work there!",
