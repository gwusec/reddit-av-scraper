I have worked for 2 different healthcare companies (an industry that is HIGHLY regulated) that allowed for SQL injection on the publicly facing login page.There is a 100% chance a data breach will occur at some point and all records related to any person's identification and browsing history on said sites will be leaked.Any one who supports this blindly supports not having any privacy for anyone for any reason. It's a blatant overstep by government and the exact opposite of patriotic.Shame."
