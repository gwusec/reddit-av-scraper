15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,Zanockthael,"In the UK, not asking for DoB for alcohol, blades or vapes is an instant offboarding offence. Regardless of the age of the person you're delivering too. Asking for the DoB of a 95 year old is pretty silly, if you ask me, but most customers are used to it now.Funny story. When this was first brought in a few years ago, we had to ask for valid ID from everyone, not just the DoB. The AMOUNT of verbal abuse we got from people over 50...That fucking rule was in place for over a year."
15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,[deleted],"Maybe it's a UK thing. You have to ask their birth year, if they are under 25 it asks you to ID them. It's mostly for alcohol"

15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,cyberspace2008,Every now and then this comes up it's just a UK and (I think?) Canada thing. Possibly just UK/Europe where Amazon delivers alcohol.You can buy ethyl alcohol from Amazon US but it's denatured.
15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,Zanockthael,"For the US amoung us, it's purely a UK thing. Not allowed to leave blades, alchohol or vape products with under 18's. But yeah, I've had AVDs that were cable ties (the woman I was delivering to was really abusive towards me about it) and also one that was a frying pan. The couple I delivered it to were confused, but they told me that it was for their teenage son. I told them that I probably needed to ask for ID, because food cooked by a teenager is a lethal weapon. They found it amusing.Also remember one that was a cheese cutting board. I mean, you'd have to try really god damn hard to stab someone with one of those. It'd be more lethal to leave it in the box and hit someone over the head with it.Edit: as an amusing side note, I ordered some *very* sharp whittling knives off Amazon and they weren't AVD, because the blades weren't quite long enough, I guess. Also, chainsaws can be left with under 18's. Go figure.It might be that the charging cable was for vapes. All vape products are age verified."
15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,Crayen5,"Oh if it's for vapes that's understandable, I thought he said it was a phone charger.I've had to ID people for stuff like bread knives and wine labels before, the laws can be quite strict. This one just threw me off a bit.Oddly enough, if you order lighters I don't think those are age verified either?"
15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,deanroy90,It's probably a requirement to avoid failed deliveries and verify the customer!
1iu4jca,AskALiberal,AutoModerator,"Moderator AnnouncementRead More ¬ªThe following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.Obviously adults should be able to watch  porn if they want, but I mean we do not allow kids to even drink until they are 18. Age verification laws require you proof that you are 18 to use stuff like Pornhub. Some more libertarians say "" oh gubmint survivance"", which I mean is one criticizm I can understand where it is coming from, even if I do not buy it myself. Some states have such laws, seems like SCOTUS will allow them based on oral arguments. Should federal government have them too? Clintin back in 90s signed such law but courts sturck it down in first amandment grounds, but seems like now court is more tolerant to such regulations.I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

1iu4jca,AskALiberal,Orbital2,"Don't like them, but it's mostly because I don't think those sites should be collecting that kind of data on users.Parents can monitor their own kids internet usage."
1iu4jca,AskALiberal,othelloinc,"What do you think about age verification laws ?I don't object to them on principle.However, I am a bit concerned about implementation. Can this be done effectively? Can it be done without privacy violations?...and...is this actually the endgame of the people pushing for it, or are they just trying to get their foot in the door for a complete ban on pornography?"
1iu4jca,AskALiberal,FifteenEchoes,"Can this be done effectively? Can it be done without privacy violations?It absolutely cannot. Digital data safety is fundamentally a losing game, at least for organizations that aren't literal CIA blacksites. It's why high-profile data breaches from big-name companies happen every year. It's not that they're not trying hard enough, it's that no amount of human care and investment can ever hope to patch all the vulnerabilities in a system of this scale and complexity. The only way to guarantee sensitive data won't be leaked is to not store it at all, and most certainly to not store it in a database that has access to the Internet....and...is this actually the endgame of the people pushing for it, or are they just trying to get their foot in the door for a complete ban on pornography?I mean obviously it is, look at Project 2025."
1iu4jca,AskALiberal,Different-Gas5704,"I believe in parents, not the government, being responsible for their children. Don't want your kid watching porn? Put a blocker on their devices. Don't want your kid going to Drag Queen Story Hour or playing Doom or listening to Twisted Sister? Don't let them. However, you have no right to parent other people's kids.If the GOP actually cared about keeping kids safe, they would be calling for RICO investigations into the Catholic Church, the Southern Baptist Convention, and other groups found to have abused thousands of children and subsequently protected the abusers from punishment."
1iu4jca,AskALiberal,MountaineerChemist10,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll make a difference.Because if you‚Äôre going to restrict pornography from teenagers & attempt to prevent porn addiction, then why haven‚Äôt you done anything to prevent Problematic Social Media Use (PSMU) yet?"
1iu4jca,AskALiberal,BoratWife,I imagine it would be better for people to advocate that parents don't give kids unlimited access to the Internet all day every day.Remember when Republicans would say that the scariest thing you could hear is 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help'?

18znr34,AskConservatives,hope-luminescence,"I think modern Internet porn is a serious public health problem. Specifically, the combination of the normalization of extreme sadomasochistic-ish content, or content seeming to depict rape and violent misogyny, along with the tendency for someone to watch alotof porn all at once and jump from video to video.I am skeptical as to whether those laws are a good, effective, Constitutional, or viable method of solving the problem."
18znr34,AskConservatives,JoeCensored,They are pointless.  Any young teen with 2 brain cells can figure out how to get passed any age verification.  The minor challenge of doing so is likely to encourage rather than deter.

1i55qty,AskUK,chonk-chonk-chonk,"IDs do get checked depending on how old they look. Ive had mine checked a few times (18 years old currently, going to shows since 13). Its not as strict as buying alcohol or anything but if they dont have proof of age they could be refused entry."
1i55qty,AskUK,let_me_use_reddit,"They may well check their ID, but it's more likely going to determine the colour of the wristband they get (i.e. can be served alcohol / cannot) rather than entry refusal. I don't think Swift's era tour would have survived otherwise."
1i55qty,AskUK,eventworker,How strict they are will depend entirely on the event.
1i55qty,AskUK,mr-dirtybassist,Yes. If you look young they will check your id
1i55qty,AskUK,Bradley_the_Buyer,"Hi everyone, just to come back on this and close the circle for anyone looking for and finding this advice in the future.I consulted o2 arena‚Äôs customer services. They confirmed that two children between the ages of 15 (under 16) and 17 (under 18) who are not in the standing area (so seated tickets only) could attend without someone 18 plus.They also made clear that ID will sometimes be checked but it is not consistent and is at the discretion of the security team working that particular event.They confirmed that original official ID is preferred but that they may accept photocopies / photos, again at the security team‚Äôs discretion.In the circumstances we decided to chance it and my daughter (14) attended with her friend (16). This was a breach of their terms.No ID checking appeared to be in operation though as I said both my daughter and her friend look much older than they are. They were able to attend the concert without issue."
1i55qty,AskUK,Sad-Huckleberry-1166,"we're going to shepherd's bush, do you think same will apply?  Also are there separate checks  for stalls etc, as we bought tickets for there."
1i55qty,AskUK,Tuarangi,"The policy clearly states that anyone under 15 has to be accompanied by an adult - in case people are somehow unaware of what an adult is, they explicitly state this is someone 18+. I am not sure where you get the idea two 15 year olds or a 15 year old with a 14 year old would be ok - a 15 year old is not an adult. If they looked over 16, they may get away with it, if they are asked for ID, they will be refused entry when they show they are not old enough.Also note than anyone under 16 cannot go in the standing area so if they were bought for that, they would be more likely to be ID checkedTicket terms:6.2¬†¬†The following restrictions apply to Events taking place at the Venue (subject to any additional age restrictions that may apply to individual Events or Venues):(a) children under 15 must be accompanied by an adult aged 18 or over; and(b) children under 16 may only enter the Event with seated Tickets and cannot enter any standing area. We will not be liable to refund any standing Tickets which have been purchased for children under 16.ETA I am assuming it's a concert without other age restrictions - some events have additional onesETA 2 - down voting me for giving you information that is correct, but that you don't want to hear is not helpful"
1i55qty,AskUK,Bradley_the_Buyer,"Thanks for this. Logically, two 15 year olds can attend by themselves without an adult in the seated area, correct? My daughter‚Äôs friend is 15, my daughter is 14, and will be about a month off being 15 at the time of the concert.An ID check would be to confirm they are both at least 15. Not many 15 year olds have official ID beyond a passport. I‚Äôm trying to ascertain the likelihood of this being specifically checked and enforced, I.e. if one of them (doesn‚Äôt matter which really) does not have ID are they likely to be refused entry?"
1gte9z6,australian,Icy_Caterpillar4834,Remembering our government used cheap servers to deploy the ATOs portal. Crashed immediately when users tried to submit a tax return online. This was an industry joke for many years until the many IT fails of COVID. More recently the government low-key removed IP Cameras from secure buildings due to the hardware and software being of CCP design and manufacturing. You would think designing/manufacturing IP Cameras locally would be a win/win and ensure a high level of security. You have absolute shit for the brains of you feel any government in Australia can solve the issue of minors on social media
1gte9z6,australian,Manmoth57,About 5 minutes then some 14/15 year old will crack the road block and it‚Äôs game over
1gte9z6,australian,VorpalSplade,There was proposals for mandatory internet filters in the early 2000s - my mum worked with an internet lobby at the time and managed to get a test copy of the internet filter software. I can confirm it took me about 5 minutes as a 15 year old to crack then (I just had a website with frames open the porn in a separate frame).
1gte9z6,australian,VorpalSplade,"It simply won't, it's ridiculous. They can't even ban piracy sites, who obviously aren't following the law - why would they be able to stop other sites?Driving kids away from 'big safe sites' and into the dark web where there's really fucked up shit is such a dumb idea."
1gte9z6,australian,FrogsMakePoorSoup,We've apparently gotta support it before we'll learn how it works.Because that's exactly how you run an IT project.

1gte9z6,australian,[deleted],Anyone who believes this is about protecting kids is utterly delusional
1gte9z6,australian,[deleted],"""Safety"" is always the excuse to implement censorship.It'll be as effective as porn websites 'verifying' people are over 18 when they enter the site."
1gte9z6,australian,xiphoidthorax,"By making this about kids, the complacent adult doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to impact them."
1g3pb1l,australia,drayraelau,"Yeah this whole thing makes no sense.What counts as social media? Facebook? Twitter? Discord? Youtube? Twitch?And now we're going to have to supply them all with our ID just to prove we're over a certain age and trust them to not misuse that?Sounds like a great, well thought out idea."
1g3pb1l,australia,Yrrebnot,Take it further. Are forums social media. What about sites with forums? Help desks? Does Steam count? The whole thing is stupid all the way down.
1g3pb1l,australia,aldkGoodAussieName,My Facebook account is older than the required age limit. Who would I still need to provide ID?

1g3pb1l,australia,evmcl,"It is actually worse than that. It is not just an age verification scheme, it is anidentityverification scheme. Otherwise, how would you verify a person's age?"
1g3pb1l,australia,FakeCurlyGherkin,"This is the real story. It's a national ID scheme by stealth. Governments have been wanting this for decades (e.g. the ""Australia Card"" in the 80s)"
1g3pb1l,australia,GloomyFondant526,"Government makes up weak piece of garbage ban to make it look like it's doing something, is a bit long for a headline."
1g3pb1l,australia,vriska1,This is going to be unworkable and will likely be delayed over and over again until it is scrapped. Also how they announced all of this has been very cart before the horse.
1g3pb1l,australia,vacri,until it is scrapedTypo is also accurate.
1h4o7zy,australia,Blitzende,"So social media is going to get age verification, porn is almost certain to get age verification...but there are ""question marks"" over gambling getting age verification? After also not passing the promised gambling adverts legislation? This does not pass the pub test"

1h4o7zy,australia,LaughIntrepid5438,"Well nothing technically. The only country where it has worked is China and it's not due to the technology, but rather socially through extreme punative actionsIt's worked because if you defy them you can get denied government services, sacked, your child can be expelled from school.They can parade you on national tele as an example for others what not to do, or just disappear you entirelyThey use absolute fear to get people to self censor - most of the time you'll get away with it but if you're the unlucky one they can absolutely ruin your life.We definitely don't want to be heading down that path."
1h4o7zy,australia,Incorrigibleness,"Since Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he would pursue a world-leading social media ban for under-16s, one question has dogged his government: how will it work?The answer! It won't!It was a colossal waste of time by the government."
1h4o7zy,australia,FreakySpook,"It was a colossal waste of time by the government.I mean we're spending more time talking about this than the fact the government completely capitulated to the sports betting lobby and we're not likely going to get any reforms on that at all now considering next year is an election year. We're also not talking nearly enough about the government not progressing with the misinformation bill either. So we can't call it a colossal waste of time, it did do something the government & coalition wanted."

1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,AvailableAfternoon76,"After what happened to the people on ashleymadison I'm never thrusting my personal info to a sight where I write/consume NSFW content. I don't know how to verify age.Honestly, maturity is something people haven't been able to fake well and immaturity isn't compatible with me. I've found that especially younger men use anime anatomy and that's incompatible with how I like to write so they filter themselves out.I just have to trust. Because there's no way I'd ask people to potentially compromise themselves in a way I wouldn't myself."
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,Yandoji,"Considering there are always going to be kids and teenagers who lie to get into adult spaces on the internet, the only way to win is to not play, lol."
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,frogandmoon,"I do not erp, but there is zero chance that I'd share any legal documents with some random app.  I'm old  and do not trust apps to keep my data safe.Underage me already used my older sister's id to get into bars (we look nearly identical).  I for sure would have done the same for an rp server.  All our important documents were in the same lockbox.  It'd be really easy for me.My rp partners thought I was 19 when I was 16.  We even met irl and they weren't suspicious because it was only a 3 years difference and it only takes minor tweeks in conversations to sound like a college kid.As long as you can write decently, people can't tell the difference.  I know at 40, I literally cannot tell a 16 and 19 year old apart by looking or by their writing.The ugly truth is, if you choose to erp with internet strangers, you are always taking the chance that you will erp with a minor and there's nothing you can do about it.  There is simply no system that is going to keep a determined minor from entering into adult spaces.  Any system you have in place is security theature."
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,soup_for_soup,"I have a set of rules that I use. One is a threshold on minimum age in the 20's. I trust zero people who tell me ""I'm 18"" out of all the people on the subreddits I think statistically it's not in their favor that they are actually 18.Two, I speak to people before we get into anything. Learn about their character, what they want out of the plot, ect. I use that to get an idea of their age and if I feel that they're immature or they might not be the age they say, I bounce.Also, No offense but instant no, I don't trust your age when I get ""gooning"" ""goonette"" ""edging"". From what I can tell those are Gen Alpha slang words...  While I like to write smut, The moment that your vocalization of pleasuring yourself comes into the pictures, I'm out!--edit--- Account age and number of posts made in a short period of time are also factors that I use."
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,ThatsJustVile,"Edging has been a thing in the BDSM community for a while as far as I know? Respect if you just don't like its use in general, just throwing that out there.I'm also approaching 30 and have found that, unfortunately,  love the word 'gooning' specifically for how awful it sounds LMAO"
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,[deleted],"As I have been approaching the age of 31 and reflecting on my 20s, the idea that someone might have lied about their age just terrifies me tbh (I used to sext anonymously on Reddit, still do it here and there but MUCH less frequently). Doesn‚Äôt help my anxiety either at this point because for some reason, my brain has recently decided to hyperfixate on this one specific topic/possibility, even though I really have no evidence or a shred of proof that such a thing has happened. Having said all that, short of asking for ID (since I think people go on these platforms to stay anonymous and don‚Äôt want to share that info, it‚Äôs invasive to ask, and a minor can just grab someone else‚Äôs ID anyways), I just ask my sexting/RP partner their age right away and double check later (asking more than once maybe after the sexting session, or a day or two later in the context of a different convo). I also don‚Äôt trust people who say they just turned 18, but tbh the anxiety of this is starting to get too much for me, to the point where I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs not really worth it, since there is no way to actually know if the other person is lying or not."
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,[deleted],"My personal method is the ultimate slowburn: I will RP with anybody but NSFW interactions between our characters will not occur until I've written and interacted with my partner for at least six real months. This has always been time enough for people faking their age to reveal themselves, particularly because very young roleplayers do not have the patience for that and will usually stop writing with me when it's clear I'm not turning our roleplay into ERP any time soon. Worked like a charm so far, and I've managed to write long, in depth and memorable stories with those who actually stuck around for it."
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,ExactHedgehog8498,That's actually smart! And also gets rid of the people in it just for erp!
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,StrawbieMilkshakes,Mad respect for making this post.That app sounds great until someone mentioned they could use a fake ID.I guess where I am is I don't care enough about ERP to keep trying it when there's any kind of serious issue to negotiate. It's frustrating that it's not just easy but oh well.
1c1jh60,BitcoinBeginners,flips712,I resubmitted my verification docs b/c it failed the first time. Now River has locked my account and canceled my reoccurring weekly buys and target buy orders. I thought they were supposed to be self-custody friendly. This started when I submitted my ID and selfie pic for verification so I could move BTC to a cold wallet. Now I can't even log into my account since they locked it. I opened the account around February. This is very frustrating

1c1jh60,BitcoinBeginners,CYjgb,"I tried to set up an account on River sevral times 6 months ago.  It was horrible.  I couldn't get it to work.  I gave up.  I got frustrated with how expensive kraken and Strike were being,  so I decided to try River again last week.  It finally worked.  I have no idea why all of a sudden it worked,  but it did.  I think they may need to iron out some bugs, but it seems to be good now that I'm on."
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,Dr_prof_Luigi,"While I certainly agree that minors should NOT be consuming p*rn (nobody should tbh), I'm not sure if it is worth normalizing submitting your ID to a website.I know some sites do this for things like tobacco products, but it is still a bit of a fringe concept.More and more people are concerned with online privacy, and this could be a serious step toward eroding our rights to use the internet (somewhat) anonymously.I'm genuinely torn on this one. Is it worth normalizing sending government documents to sites you visit (submitting your papers)?imo, parents should just be more aware of what their kids do online.It doesn't effect me, and maybe requiring people to submit ID will make them hesitate which could be a net good"
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,CrabofAsclepius,People already submit their IDs and even biometrics to companies known to sell that information like Amazon and Meta. Not only that but there are apps that track such things as per their ToS like TikTok.This isn't really anything that people aren't already doing.
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,Zetjex,While i think it is important to try and stop kids for finding porn online putting your ID in goes too far. Parents should be responsible for their kids internet behaviour. And schools need to teach internet safety incase they don't do that yet.
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,Chrissyjustshowus,It‚Äôs just government just sitting in for no reason
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,bsheelflip,"It‚Äôs a good idea. For a kid to engage with ‚Äúadult content‚Äù 40 years ago they‚Äôd have had to steal it from the seedy gas station joint in town or wait until they had an ID and submit it at the desk. The consequence of our digital age is that there is no such barrier anymore. I was an unwitting victim of this, and my friends exposed me to it without me wanting it at an early age. What we stand to lose in sacrificing what we assume is anonymity we stand to gain so much more culturally and societally. Today is different than those days even, and what was once a seedy back-alley joint is now so integrated into our society that the pornstars are our neighbors. Supply and demand is so weird for sex these days and, like it or not, fostering a good relationship between the ‚Äúsupply‚Äù and ‚Äúdemand‚Äù is actually paramount to a good society. We‚Äôre in a stalemate where our sons are telling our daughters ‚Äúput the OF down‚Äù our daughters telling our sons ‚Äústop creating the demand‚Äù. Why don‚Äôt you guys stop fighting and just go make babies already? Alas, I see it going nowhere without intervention."
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,h_91_DRbull,It asked about this specific policy. You said this subject is terrible - something must be done. Appreciate you opening up your emotions on the issue - but what about on if forcing us to submit our official government ID credentials over the internet to access publicly available spaces a good law?
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,madamluxe,"I cam on SC and lately I‚Äôve had to put in more hours just to make my average since it‚Äôs been slow. But that‚Äôs expected with post holiday slowness. Unfortunately since PH is now blocking those states, advertising is taking a hit, which trickles down to sites that advertise there, which ultimately impacts us."
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,ScarletBlond,Thats a good point about the advertising reduction.Do you know if SC is asking for age verification from it's members in these states yet?
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,ShesSoInky,"FYI 16 out of the 19 already had these requirements in place for most of 2024 - Florida, Tennessee and South Carolina were added as of January 1st.This is the full list of states where pornhub is now no longer available and where ageverification of some type is required to access ""adult"" content:Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Virginia."
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,Warden_Knox,*PH has made itself unavailable in those states
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,[deleted],YES. Big drop since Jan 1. Total bs. ü§¨https://avpassociation.com/4271-2/
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,ScarletBlond,"Good link, thx!"
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,morticiamyers,"This is interesting to navigate. Does this mean our social media needs to be cleaned up, or is the social site responsible for that?"
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,AstraNaughty321,This is probably the most important information that has been posted in this community and I hope people will take this seriously.
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Strictdaddy17,Completely agree and ty OP.  If i had an award I'd give it to you üòÖ
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Sunnythebunnie,I feel like all sex workers should know no matter what our jobs are always under attack! We should care about these things but a lot don‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm here to say I care. I have back up plan no matter what.
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,ShesSoInky,"I think some people care but for the wrong reasons - in this instance they care about kids not having access to porn.  Totally a good thing to care about.  But they don't look beyond that.  We're bombarded all the time these days with so much shit its overwhelming so when we hear a simple one we just ""YUP I support that one!"" but looking a bit further in to it tells you maybe you shouldn't.This is how I make my living but I had a vanilla career for over a decade before this.  If I have to go back to it I will.  But I don't want to.  And I certainly don't want to because I have no choice.  And I know a lot of people doing this work DON'T have anything to fall back on....so it's not just fear for myself.  But for others as well.  Which a lot of people are missing.....which is how we got here.  Thinking ""well that doesnt apply to me"" - it will if you don't have a dick.  In one way or another."
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Jade_Next_Door,"Well said üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ It amazes me those who are like, 'there will always be SW and a market for it'. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Clearly, a market existing is not the issue. There's a market for CSAM, drugs, child marriages, trafficking, hacking, etc.Then the comments of, 'things won't be impossible, we'll be fine'. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  So weird to be acceptable with a standard of ""not impossible"". That's a whole problematic mentality in such circumstances.The point is that we shouldn't have to jump through circus hoops, have our rights stripped, and then be penalized for doing what we want, profit from, and consent to with our bodies. People are gonna survive doing what they need to do no matter what. But adding all these unnecessary hurdles and punishments so that it limits the people while benefiting those up top is the issue. Capitalism at its finest. We literally could be living in a much better circumstance, but capitalists are more than happy to create long-term/generational destruction of the masses just to say they topped the next best thing."
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,ShesSoInky,Honestly the fact that the market exists and is SO strong is the most terrifying part.  Because they will still want it. They just wont have to pay for it anymore.  And we won't be doing it by choice if they have their way.
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Lizard_Zepplin,"it‚Äôs all their big plan to get more wage slaves, people aren‚Äôt having kids anymore for a multitude of reasons, and the rich aren‚Äôt happy about it. So how do they fix it? Ban abortions so people are forced to have kids, ban being gay or LGBTQ+ so people are breeding more, ban porn so people are wound up and horny and breeding. That‚Äôs all this sick plan is leading to, making more wage slaves in the working class so we can be exploited. This country is truly becoming disgusting, i‚Äôve been planning on moving out of country for years now (been saving up) and hopefully i can ik the next year or 2."
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,littlerosexo,"Myself and a few others in the industry have been yelling about P2025 since the end of 2023, and I wholeheartedly believed that if democrats just had the balls to talk about sex workers, it would have been the bridge to the young men and kinda-conservatives who could have swung the election back to sanity.But more insidious than fucking with out lives and livelihoods is the fact that sex workers are being used as the canary in a coal mine for the mass incarceration, erasure, and eventual extermination of other groups that will be classified as ""obscene"". Starting with the trans community.Russell Vought, co-author of P2025 is now the head of the US Office of Management and Budget. Oklahoma senator Dusty Deevers has introduced a bill criminalizing adult content of any kind. IfOK SB593passes at the state level, it becomes that much easier to use as precident to adopt the law nationwide.Everything we warned about is here. The time for prevention is past, and all we can do now is fight. None of us will ever be ""one of the good ones"" to the Christian Nationalists, so being meek won't change a thing for us. All of us need to be loud on our platforms, do everything we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones, resist in every way possible, and never obey in advance."
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Gwennie_pooh,I really just want to live my life and exist! I'm trans and this whole administration has made me feel like its a matter of time before I'm swept up and put in prison. With the fact he wants to ban porn but also just being gay or queer is so scary! I just wish more people would take this all more serious it will effect lives no ifs and or but about it.
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,HairyBiAmelia,Thank you for this helpful summary!! Your labor is appreciated üíú‚ú®
1bz23lw,changemyview,reginald-aka-bubbles,"Honest question since i've never used one, but is there any form of age verification for these sites?"
1bz23lw,changemyview,Real-Ruin-5446,Not from my knowledge. I‚Äôve never had to verify while making Grindr.
1bz23lw,changemyview,Ancquar,"Never used Grindr, but on Tinder you have a whole lot of women from 19 to early 20s whose profile text literally says that they are a year or two younger than their age in profile. I always assumed that a significant number of them ended up with this discrepancy because they created the profile before 18, but obviously did not explicitly write their actual age before 18."
1bz23lw,changemyview,madamevanessa98,"Lying about your age is wrong. However, IMO a lot of people are also pursuing 18 year olds who should be aiming older to begin with (personally I think anyone over 22-23 shouldn‚Äôt be dating 18y/o) and I think the less time you spend around kids/teens the worse you get at gauging their age. Sometimes you can absolutely tell that someone is young, and in those situations you should be verifying their age yourself to be safe, or date OLDER people who you don‚Äôt have to wonder are too young. I think a lot of the time when a girl lies about her age especially, men can tell she looks young but they don‚Äôt really care, they‚Äôd rather not ask, fuck her anyway, and have plausible deniability. You should never be so horny that you don‚Äôt use your judgement."
1bz23lw,changemyview,TateIsKing,"In most jurisdictions it's a strict liability crime, meaning even if the minor shows a fake ID that looks real, the adult has no defense."
1bz23lw,changemyview,SMA2343,"I know in many places that‚Äôs a defence for Statutory rape.For example, you‚Äôre at a club. You flirt with a girl and you go back and have sex. You have down your due diligence by 1) asking her ‚Äúhow old are you?‚Äù And if she says 21 you can think: ‚Äúwell you are in club, and holding an alcoholic drink. I can deduce you are of legal age.‚ÄùThere was many stepping stones for the underage person to pass through to get to you. The bouncer that checks the ID. Maybe even the person giving drinks checks ID as well. And if she had a good story of she‚Äôs in university taking classes and knows professors names for some reason.There was a lot for you to believe she is of legal age."
1bz23lw,changemyview,Poly_and_RA,"Do you have a source for that claim? In my jurisdiction (Norway) that isNOT true.Instead the rules about age of consent here go like this:The age of consent is 16 -- it's legal for anyone not in a position of authority or a near relative to have consensual sex with people above that age.There's no punishment for sex with someone under 16 if the involved are similar in age or development; not codified in the law exactly what this means but if you look at verdicts you see that courts have tended to interpret this as less than 3 years of age-gap is okay. (so a 17 year old with a 15 year old partner won't get in trouble, but a 19 year old with a 15 year old partner will)However, if the younger person is older than 14, then sex with them is punishable only if the older person either knew, or SHOULD have known that they are too young. If they have no blame for not knowing this, then there is no punishment. A case I remember is a guy who got accused of sex with an underage girl after he'd had sex with a girl he'd met in a bar. She had faked her ID to get in even though she was only 15. Court said it's *reasonable* to believe that women you meet in an 18+ bar are in fact older than 16, so he wasn't to blame for not knowing that she is underage -- and thus acquitted."
1bz23lw,changemyview,Kotoperek,"You should usually have at least a brief conversation with someone before you start sexting them, especially since they look very young as in close to 18 and you aren't sure whether they really are. If someone is making up an entire persona and lying about their job when they are really in school and so on, that is on them I guess. But usually it is easy to see someone is a minor by the way they text and their choice of topics. If you're also barely 18 or 19, it's fine, nobody would charge you with pedophilia for interacting with a 16-year-old. If you're in your twenties maybe just don't date barely legal teens as a rule of thumb."
1bz23lw,changemyview,DoeCommaJohn,"I‚Äôd still say that they are a victim, but their date on the app is not the perpetrator. However, a minor who believes that they should be dating an adult is likely in a bad situation through some combination of parental neglect and outside influences (friends, social media, etc). If we can agree that the child should not be doing that and a typical child would not be doing that, and a child is not fully responsible for their actions, that must mean they are a victim on some level"
1bz23lw,changemyview,Wand3ring3yes,"Nah dude, you're in the wrong. My protocol when it came to online dating was to always ask age, and if they aren't of age to be on the site, report them (multiple times if necessary) and stop messaging. In the long run getting them banned will save them from eventually coming into contact with a creeper."
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,[deleted],"parental controls exist for a reason. I'm an adult, I should not have to be punished because of shitty parents."
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,Only_Climate2852,"Why can't we just put a button that says ""I'm over the age of 18""?"
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,BuildingRoutine8051,And the next thing you know someone posted all the IDs on Discord or even selling it online
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,not_the_glue_eater,"I think it's generally agreed upon that the majority of people disagree on the ID stance. Who would want their full name, address, appearance, and more leaked onto a potentially flawed AI website? So many things could obviously go wrong here, and those who think otherwise just might be naive.I would rather destroy all my traces of existence and legally go missing before I ever leak my data to an AI website. AI platform accounts should be kept anonymous or at least minimally invasive for a reason.Edit: Luckily, we know that the devs most likely won't listen in regards to both the people who want IDs checked and the ones who don't, so it seems we're good here /srs"
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,Faulty--coding,"I don't like the ID thing at all but there definitely should be some kind of age verification in place. Even something simple where you agree you're over 18. Not only will this cover the ass of c ai from lawsuits but it means they can stop baby proofing the site and making adults suffer. No matter what's in place, kids are going to try and use the site.People need to acknowledge that parents are responsible for their kids and what they do online. It's up to them to check what they're up to and to teach them to use the Internet in a safe way. It's not up to sites to parent children.Making the site 'family friendly' isn't going to work because LLM won't ever be family friendly, things will always slip through the cracks unless it's so restrictive that it becomes unusable. The responsibility of a kid's internet experience is down to the parents."
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,SteveTheOrca,"... I know why some people are recommending the idea, but I'm not taking it. Like, I don't know, it doesn't sit well with me.Why would I give my personal and confidential data to a random site just to chat with Roblox Guest?"
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,AP_0909,Exactly. I am NOT giving official docs to anything online like this üò≠üôè
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,alexroux,"There are a few possibilities how an age verification could be implemented; for example, through linking your Google account to the site. It should have data on your birthday already and a lot of other sites ask for it, too. I had to verify my age with my ID years ago on my Google profile."
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,CHONPSCa,"honestly just do it like how steam do it. ""what's your birthday?""january 1 1901"
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,MysteriousLeek8024,"Idiots. Every. Last. One. Of. Theme. I like cai and still use it, can't stop, but THIS. This is crossing the line even for me. No way in hrll am I giving my ID. Fuck that."

1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,Interrogatus,Guess I gotta dig out the old ring light. ;)
1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,dragonsfire14,Yep! Super easy. As soon as I finished it let me back on. Hope this helps get rid of the account sharers and people working from unauthorized countries. May help with the drought!
1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,[deleted],"I feel like perhaps this is the reason there was even a drought in the first place. I think too many people were on there submitting data that wasn't usable, from places and accounts that weren't legit and they had to do an overhaul. The projects have been slowly trickling back in for me, thankfully!"
1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,[deleted],"Nope, haven't gotten that notice at all."
1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,xSarabean,"I haven't either, but I still have access to projects"
1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,trexboob,Real pain in the ass if you have glasses and the screen tells you to take them off. They're giving you directions on the screen where to turn but I'm too blind to see it.
1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,VanessaSeaWitch,I feel your pain. I had to do this for three different jobs I was applying to earlier this year and I had the same problem. I had to keep retrying until I memorized their directions lol.
1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,Jazzlike_Problem_489,Yes just popped up for me too. It states that it will be rolled out to all active members. Only took me 2 minutes. The loading time afterwards took about 5 minutes to verify but it's all done and I'm back to working üëå
1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,No_Parsley5801,Is it bad that I did not get this? I still have projects and the chat
1fdtjb7,DataAnnotationTech,Bostonlg81,"I recently lost my ID but have backup photos, I'm concerned about this as I'm waiting for a replacement.  Is it an upload or a live photo?  just so I'm prepared."
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,[deleted],Same here. Either a client is requiring it or they themselves are struggling with fraud
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,valprehension,"Either some legislation changed, or one of their clients requested it, most likely."
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,Sindorella,"With the amount of people I have had messaging me asking me to take the test for them or offering to give me a cut of an account they work if I create it for them, I am assuming they want to cut down on fraud. I can't be the only person getting those stupid messages regularly."
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,gusu_melody,"Wow! Hasn‚Äôt happened to me, but I don‚Äôt post on here too often."
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,dragonsfire14,"I wondered the same. This seems like something you‚Äôd do in the beginning, not months or years later. My only guess is they‚Äôre trying to crack down on account sharers or workers in unauthorized countries."
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,MonsterMeggu,It's probably a new feature. They didn't think fraud would be so rampant at first. And now they need to crack down on it.
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,SajraJay,"I‚Äôve been on for 18 months and haven‚Äôt been asked yet. At one time, there was a qual to complete a background check but I didn‚Äôt take it. I had just started with DA and wasn‚Äôt sure if I trusted them enough to give all of my info."
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,publicdefecation,I'm guessing it's to cut down on scammers flooding the platform.
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,good_god_lemon1,They realized they need it with the rise in shared and sold accounts where Johnny Appleseed‚Äôs account is being worked by Abara in Nigeria.
1fj68od,DataAnnotationTech,Hangry_Howie,There's a whole industry popping up around shady ass groups offering to work off someone's account for money.

1aw7f3f,dating,Alexis2337,"Sorry you experienced something like that! I dont know how really common that that happens usually, but I haven't heard much of situations like that really occur as often. (I prefer to meet in real life), but online apps can sometimes make people test the limits sometimes if they're being truthful or not. Because I would assume whoever is starting to look for a relationship would be comfortable in their own skin and be true to themselves etc. He looked young for his age, which you mentioned and he just took advantage of that and lied.It's messed up on his part because if he's really insecure about that then I wonder what more lies he'll do down the line you know? It also is messed up cause it can then cause trust issues for anyone down the road and it looks like it's gotten to you unfortunately, which is totally valid. I wouldnt beat yourself up for it and what you went through, it's not your fault at all and it doesnt make you any less for not knowing, anyone possibly could have been fooled also.In the future with whoever your seeing, if you still feel a bit worried of a persons age or having doubts, it wouldnt be weird at all to mention this story you explained to the person and make sure they are being honest with the age they tell you etc. Surely they'll understand provided the context you mention.

1i3kmbx,Destiny,Cellophane7,"If I have to give my ID to watch porn, that's an insane fucking invasion of privacy. And for what? So kids won't watch porn? Who gives a shit? Is there a single person alive today who didn't at leastpeekat porn out of curiosity when they were underage? How many of our ancestors stole nudie magazines and hid them from their parents? How long are we gonna pretend teenagers are asexual creatures when they're in the middle of exploding sexually, metaphorically and literally?It's extreme government overreach for absolutely no legitimate reason. The only goal these fascists have is to control us as much as possible so they can keep us in like. I couldn't possibly oppose this shit more."
1i3kmbx,Destiny,FrostyArctic47,"And where's the line going to be? Conservatives have already argued that any mention, reference, depiction, acknowledgement of gays, in any way, is pornographic, among other things."

1i3kmbx,Destiny,Top_Gun_2021,It's the parents/network admins job to restrict access.
1i3kmbx,Destiny,Public-Variation-940,"Nothing wrong with it in principle, it‚Äôs just practically ridiculous."
1i3kmbx,Destiny,TheMarbleTrouble,"It‚Äôs a way to avoid fixing the issue, while painting those that have solutions as wanting kids to watch porn.The issue is that parents do not have time to be with their kids. Watching porn or watching Tate, is the direct outcome of parents not being able to be with their kids. We need things like the child tax credit proposed by Harris, but beyond first few years. The priority should be helping parents be able to inhibit bad behavior of their kids, regardless of it being porn or tide pod eating tick tock challenges.This ban will not impact a single porn site that broadcasts from outside US. The only sites that will be impacted by this are the legitimate sites like PornHub, that don‚Äôt really have some of the nastiest shit online. Two girls and a cup is one of the nastiest porn that is commonly known, which hit mainstream without just being on a porn site. To execute the ID restriction effectively, they would need national filtering that currently exists in China and Russia. Not just for porn sites, but all sites being able to display images or video‚Ä¶ which is all of them.This will not solve the problem, but becomes an excuse to avoid addressing the problem and might result in significant limitation to what is viewable on US Internet."
1i3kmbx,Destiny,[deleted],"It's inevitable but there are much better ways to do it. Pornhub is trying to push for device based authentication where your Apple/Google/Microsoft account has a proven ID verified age set. The porn service (or any other 18+ site) then makes an anonymous call to them and due to restrictions placed on those accounts, can only retrieve validation of your age. Apple/Google/Microsoft would have no idea what the service is, just that you authorized something to verify your age. I think this is much better than submitting your photo ID or image of your face to an unknown third party."
1i3kmbx,Destiny,[deleted],"It's fucking regarded to make Americans give their identifying information to access porn. This shit could be breached and that's how you end up with data hackers threatening to send your porn searches to your family unless you pay 500 dollars. Or even worse, politicians pressured to vote for specific laws under threat of revealing their porn browsing habits. Nothing good comes of this."

roxpzt,discordapp,[deleted],"If you want a strong verification system, require users to provide a photo with the following:User is holding an ID with the photo, date of birth intact and everything else redacted.Users face clearly visible in the photo.Piece of paper (also held) containing the server name, users name, and a random word selected by the verifying admin."
roxpzt,discordapp,[deleted],If someone gives you their face for a verification  it's still not safe since you just got their private information. Because of that system you can get all of your accounts banned and the server too. It's easy to photoshop so all I can say is that there is no way to verificate users if they are 18 and still not breaking ToS. It's just better to set normal verification(with click of a button). The answer is:There is no real way to verify users if they are 18 with 100% success rate.
roxpzt,discordapp,Aurora_Beaurealis,"A server I was in did that, we needed to use our passport showing our picture and date of birth, along with our discord tag name. We would send that to a mod and after verification it would be deleted. Thing is it could have been someone else which is the problem.I would just go ahead with the verification and any minor found in the channels you ban them. They have broken the rules set up by the server and you are protecting yourself and the server. If they want to be in the server then they behave."

1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Extra_Compote_7513,Huh? Where do you live? None of us had to do that from what I know of. Never heard of it at all.
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Ball_Full,"I live in the states.  The age verification through credit card only happened after I accidentally put in the wrong age. I've only been able to confirm one other instance of this happening whilst doing research trying find a solution for this issue. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling/removing from account nothing has worked so far.  In fact, as of writing this I still haven't received an email verification. Only other means for a solution I guess is going through the support that states having a 72 hour window for response times."
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Scourge_Azotar,Isnt the account your steam account?
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Ball_Full,"Yeah, it‚Äôs through steam. As far as i know it‚Äôs because I entered the wrong age so the game flagged my account as a minor, and because it was flagged as a minor it wanted verification through credit card from a ‚Äúparent or guardian‚Äù (their words) giving permission to play the game(which I did with a visa gift card to be safe). It‚Äôs a weird way of verifying age/ consent from a legal guardian in my opinion, but that‚Äôs their process. There‚Äôs additional verification needed even after doing this in order to use voip/ add or invite friends which I‚Äôm still unable to do. I‚Äôm even unable to see steam friends through the game until this additional verification is done. (They email a code which I still haven‚Äôt received)."
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Hawkryl,Did you find a solution to resetting this? I was just clicking through and didn't notice until it asked for a credit card.
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Ball_Full,nah still no solution other than entering cc info otherwise I suppose you can make a new steam account which I don‚Äôt plan on doing. I‚Äôll continue playing dndr instead

1i20s3n,fourthwavewomen,goddamitletmesleep,"While age verification is a necessary step, it is far from a solution. The broader issue remains the same: pornography is a billion-dollar industry built on the degradation, exploitation and objectification of women. Until that reality is confronted head-on, no legal restriction will be enough to counteract its damage.The widespread normalization of pornography has fueled a culture where sexual violence, misogyny and exploitation are dressed up as ""entertainment."" Porn isn't just harmful to children - it's harmful to everyone, particularly women. It shapes how men view sex and relationships, warping their expectations and increasing demand for violent, degrading content. It shapes how women perceive themselves, their bodies and their boundaries. Studies have shown links between porn consumption and increased male sexual aggression, yet the industry remains largely unregulated. The bigger fight isn't just about restricting access...it‚Äôs about dismantling the lie that pornography is harmless, empowering, or just another form of entertainment."

1i20s3n,fourthwavewomen,yellowblpssoms,Lol! It is hilarious
1i20s3n,fourthwavewomen,chaoticfia,"clarifying some of the legal technicalities: the SC isn't evaluating if it's constitutional to have ANY age block, or judging 1A stuff, (at least as far as I'm aware), but rather evaluating if the Texas standard (more than 1/3 adult content) is too broad (which tbh it might - they don't define what constitutes 1/3: 1/3 of pages, 1/3 of bytes, 1/3 of user traffic? plus it will apply to sites w up to 2/3 non-adult content, so there's a decent chance it might be struck down for being too broad, and the law may be passed with a revised scope (ie. more than 1/2 of user traffic))"

Then about 10 days ago WMR changed to ""We cannot provide any information about your refund."" Then I received the 5071c letter on 5/14 asking me to verify my identity. Thewww.idverify.irs.govtool did not work. I had an IRS account set up before all of this. Tool said it could not process my verification. Called number about 40 times and it wouldn't let me through. Called to make an appointment to verify in person. There were no appointments available within a 50 mile radius through July 30th. They couldn't look any further out. On the 5071c letter there is a number for a Tax Advocate (TAS). Called on 5/20 and waited on hold 30 mins for TAS. He was very nice and put me through to the Verification Hotline directly so that I would not get the ""cannot take your call due to high call volume"" hang up. Waited on hold another 40 mins and spoke to the dept. that verifies ID. He asked me details about my 2020 and 2019 tax returns, my parents names moms maiden name, details on a W-2 and the usual personal ID info. He cleared the hold on my return. I will update when I get my DD or DDD.UPDATE: Got my DDD 8 days after ID verify.  My DDD is 14 days after ID Verify. Before yesterday 5/20/21, the WMR tool did not recognize me, then today it recognized me and gave me a DDD"

194uvqu,legaladviceofftopic,jeroen-79,Even if Pornhub took money from people in Utah I don‚Äôt see how Utah would have any jurisdiction against the website.Pornhub doing business with Utahians in Utah would be why Utah may assume jurisdiction over Pornhub.If Pornhub has no physical presence in Utah at all exercising that jurisdiction would rely on the assistance of other states or countries.If Utah issues Pornhub a fine and Pornhub is heaquartered in California then Utah could ask California to enforce the fine.Then California would have to decide if it prefers having good relations with Utah or the business Pornhub brings to the state.Pornhub may also decide that playing nice with states it is not in may benefit them in the future if things change and they want to do more business there.That may be easier if they have been trying to abide by their laws than if they have never respected any of these laws.
194uvqu,legaladviceofftopic,gnfnrf,"There is a broad and not entirely consistent set of case law about jurisdiction in case involving commerce over the Internet.But the prevailing test right now is the Zippo test, (from a case involving two companies named Zippo) which says that if you have a website with an ongoing and interactive relationship with customers, there is jurisdiction in the locale of those customers.  If your website simply offers information without creating a commercial or interactive relationship, there is not.So, extending that to online porn, those sites are trying to make money by selling premium accounts or making referrals to other sites that sell premium accounts.  It is certainly arguable that is an ongoing and interactive relationship under Zippo (though a purely advertising supported site is probably not, from other rulings, unless the advertising is targeted to the specific jurisdiction).An entirely free and non-commercial site that said ""here are pictures of naked ladies/men, have at it"" would probably not be in the same situation.But these things are complicated, and it is likely that the fear of an expensive court case is enough to have a chilling effect on businesses, even if they would prevail against the law in the end."

wtan2k,MUD,DarqueHorse,"We don't do age verification on Sundering Shadows but we make a clear statement that it's an adult game and under 18 is not allowed. That said, if someone decides to enter anyways, it's on them.We also do not mechanically allow child characters to be made. The lowest age for a character in game is 18 (unless it's an elf and then it's like 100). We also do not allow descriptions that in any way suggest the character is a child.Unless you're a monetized game, I don't see that population is super important. It's far better to play with people who share your gaming values."
wtan2k,MUD,[deleted],Thank you for the thoughtful response.
wtan2k,MUD,TedCruzIsAPedo,"Do what you need to do to give yourself peace of mind.Personally, I would be more inclined to hand my ID to a third-party identification system, rather than directly to a MUD admin. Services offered by sites like AgeChecker usually cost $20-30 month at the minimum. WithPersona offers a starter-level service for 500 checks/month free, which might be worth looking into, but I don't have experience with personally.It's important to feel good about the game you're running and the community you're trying to cultivate. If I was in your position I'd likely make similar considerations."
wtan2k,MUD,[deleted],"Yes, absolutely. I would never implement my own age verification system -- there are well-established (trusted) vendors available at affordable rates."
wtan2k,MUD,[deleted],I've been looking at Veriff -- but I'm not yet familiar with the available products/services.
wtan2k,MUD,Walmart_HeadReciever,The last thing I would want to do is give a mud anymore personal information.Probably easier to just monitor how mature someone acts.
wtan2k,MUD,FluffyCasual,"What do you mean by ""verification""?If you want to set a rule, that's pretty normal, and you can enforce it by banning people who admit to having broken it, but unless you're both collecting personal information and verifying that the people sending it to you aren't using some other person's name, I'm not sure how this is expected to catch the people who just lie. Faking a social media presence isn't at all hard, either.I think I recall some NSFW game asking for photos of government-issued ID, but that sets off some alarms in my head."
wtan2k,MUD,[deleted],"In terms of games -- age verification is most common in onlinegambling(due to legal requirements). But there's a growing movement to help protect children online with mitigating factors like age verification. Roblox has introduced this requirement for some features, such as voice chat.No system is 100% effective, but it's a question (to myself) of whether or not I'm doing my due diligence. Especially with something like an anonymous roleplaying environment with adult themes.If you want to join a public library or enter a bar, you often have to provide government-issued ID. I'm heavily leaning toward extending that norm to the Internet."
wtan2k,MUD,shevy-java,"I don't think it would add a huge burden in regards to limiting players (since you exclude e. g. minors).Personally, though, I don't think I would want to go through any hoops for having to verify my age. This is less about having an issue with it per se (I guess I can convincingly demonstrate that I am above 18 years of age), but more to do with being incredibly lazy. For instance, I absolutely hate captchas. Every time it feels as if it is done to just waste my time. I often am incorrect in regards to captchas.In regards to age verification: I actually started to play MUDs at age 15. If there would have been an age gate then I don't think I would have ever started simply because my interests shifted quickly past age 18. And time constraints became more prevalent. So I don't know ... I can kind of understand the rationale but I am not sure I agree with it."
wtan2k,MUD,the_andruid,"I think if you're upfront about why you're asking players to go through the check, making it as easy as possible, and using a trusted vendor, you'll have folks who are on board.You could have something like a 1 week grace period so that players have a chance to try the game out and decide whether they like it first. If you use a service that charges per accepted verification, you'll also save some money that way.Either way, peace of mind is hugely important for someone in an admin/staffer position and can help prevent burnout. If you think it'll help, I say give it a try. If it doesn't work out, you can always change it later."
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,diannethegeek,"""We proactively made staffing changes"" No, their entire staff walked out in April. If they fired anyone, they took desperate measures to hide it, letting Faulkner step out gracefully on his own terms and hiding the staff page once people started to ask why others were missing."
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,Apothecary-Apollo30,Honestly not surprised they don't want to outright admit that the staff left or that the grooming incident was handled really horribly and took longer than necessary and they also victim blamed the victims lmaoOf course they'll never outright admit THEY were at fault for anything lolJust blame the community. See how well your dumpster fire stays afloat.
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,Routine_Pumpkin8438,Is it just me or did this feel weirdly condescending/ blaming the community?
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,FieryArtemis,That‚Äôs how I felt too. Maybe they did get some truly vitriol that could be classified as harassment and bullying but it couldn‚Äôt have been the community as a whole. Yet they are admonishing us like we are all perpetrators. Interesting take to have when they post the link to donate right after the email.
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,Lost_Type2262,"Nope, not just you. Classic ""sorry you were offended"" energy. Not a sincere apology."
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,Nastybirdy,"""and we didn‚Äôt anticipate that our post would be treated as such"" or ""How dare you interpret our words in the way we wrote them!""There's so many little digs at the community all through this email. It's OUR fault for reacting the way we did. OUR fault for responding to their statements the way we did. Never their fault because they're ""a small, imperfect team"".Unimpressed."
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,bioticspacewizard,"""Our comments last month were prompted by intense harassment and bullying we were seeing on our social media channels, which specifically involved AI. When our spaces become overwhelmed with issues that don‚Äôt relate to our core offering, and that are venomous in tone, our ability to cheer on writers is seriously derailed.""I genuinely don't think that NaNoWriMo understands what harassment and bullying are. They keep using this in defense of their actions, but all I've seen are people raising genuine concerns and them being swept aside as ""vitriol.""Literally, all of this could have been avoided by making a clear, open, and public channel of communication with the community."
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,notantonbaine,"So basically ""We want to talk about our error with the AI statement that made you all abandon ship by... saying that our AI stance is crucial to 'the spirit of nano' and us shutting down the forums last year instead of taking any other action is good actually."""
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,[deleted],"I realized yesterday that Kilby's author headshot is literally AI generated, so I'm no longer even a little surprised that the goal is to double down on supporting AI as much as possible with her in charge."
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,RealAnise,"Are they going to apologize for calling criticism of AI ""ableist?"" The steel plate in my head would like to know."
1cyeujd,NewTubers,AudibleNoodles,I was able to do the video verification when I tried to add a ‚Äúrelated video‚Äù to one of my shorts. It will send a link to your email which will send you to a page with instructions where you record a video of your face.
1cyeujd,NewTubers,OCDcentral,Thank you so much for your comment. I'm trying to figure out how to do just that. So far I could not find how to do it.
1cyeujd,NewTubers,Jiggle-BellyGaming,"Google already has more info on you than you could imagine, your ID isn't some big PII threat in comparison"
1cyeujd,NewTubers,OCDcentral,"I was waiting for a comment like that but I don't really disagree with you. I just don't feel like potentially giving them something they might not have. Trust me, a part of me ridicules myself for even saying that because they probably have EVERYTHING but I just really don't feel like uploading this ID."
1cyeujd,NewTubers,DaddyMoshe,"I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre overly paranoid. But that‚Äôs your choice, and my opinion. I mean, you use all of google‚Äôs free services daily already, so all of your information is theirs anyway. I‚Äôd rather youtube (google) have my ID than all my data l have on my phones, computer, drives, anything else. It‚Äôs the price you pay though, for ‚Äúfree‚Äù service"
1cyeujd,NewTubers,OCDcentral,"Just like I didn't dispute what the other person said, I'm not disputing what you're saying. Just feels crazy to give them this as well."
1cyeujd,NewTubers,JASHIKO_,"If you're planning on being monetised you will need to hand over a lot more information as well. Tax info, ID, address, bank details, etc. So if that's you're goal there's no avoiding giving up the data."
1cyeujd,NewTubers,Carter_Azathoth,I‚Äôm an overly paranoid person as well so I get it but I did it and I‚Äôve had no issues. I looked at it more as if a job was request an ID since you‚Äôll need to give them even more personal info to earn money from your videos.
1cyeujd,NewTubers,MichaelGoosebumpsfan,"People should be more angry about this, and I would absolutely never recommend doing it. There‚Äôs no reason for them to know who you are, and if anyone in this comments section tells you otherwise, they‚Äôre dumb and part of the problem."
1cyeujd,NewTubers,uffno,"yeah, Idiocracy. Humanity is getting dumber."
1c37zq7,OculusQuest,jTiKey,So you ignore a warning and now you have to wait few days? The horror.
1c37zq7,OculusQuest,MindSponge78,"True, I should have payed more attention. But I still find it annoying that when I try to use one of the two systems that meta wants me to use to verify my age, one of them doesn't work.Also, while it was a bit late. I still did it before the date set."
1c37zq7,OculusQuest,SQUIDWARD360,Lesson learned
1c37zq7,OculusQuest,jakejm79,Is it an actual Credit Card or just a Debit Card with a Credit Card logo?
1c37zq7,OculusQuest,MindSponge78,It is a normal credit card. Not a debit card.
1c37zq7,OculusQuest,ChairAcceptable3451,"I know I'm late but right now I am also having the same problem, support is so bad and I keep on getting sent to a error page too. I'm just asking, did U get your account back?"
1c37zq7,OculusQuest,[deleted],"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a lesson to be learnt I received the prompt because my brother launched Roblox, it‚Äôs intrusive and ridiculous in my opinion, I‚Äôve never had a gaming device of any kind try to pull this shit"
1c37zq7,OculusQuest,MindSponge78,"Also, having read a lot of posts regarding age verification, if they deny or reject the sent in pictures and you fail to satisfy their requirements, you account will get deleted. This will end up removing all your games you have purchased.Why not just block the accounts ability to use the meta store and make it unable to play online. The fact that they can stop you from using your device unless you make a new account and start all over buying the same apps and games again, with the risk of it happening again."

18yv59n,Ohio,Conscious_Currency77,"Hey, thanks for posting this information. I submitted a ticket, but I think I'll probably have to go in person as well. This is so frustrating."
18yv59n,Ohio,pcfreak4,"Have same issue, filled a ticket with them and eventually got a phone call and they got just told me to go renew my license in person because it‚Äôll likely be months before they fix this."
1bzv0yb,onguardforthee,jmac1915,When will the parents pushing for this shit take responsibility for what their goddamn children have access to?
1bzv0yb,onguardforthee,fredy31,"How did little timmy see sodomy? Wont someone think of the children???Did you, idk, install firewalls, make sure your kid doesn't have 100% free access to the internet (like the tablet in his room with no supervision)No ITS THE GOVERNMENT THAT SHOULD DO SOMETHING.ffs, my dad had an easy solution to this; no PCs in our rooms, the family pc was in the middle of the living room. That makes you wont watch porn lol"
1bzv0yb,onguardforthee,remimorin,Exactly this and only this.Legislation is not a substitute to parenting and never was.

1bzv0yb,onguardforthee,howismyspelling,"I don't care how many people view me as immoral or gross in public socials or just in general public, I will alwaysalwayspush back against this insane overreach power grab. It happens to be over a situation that people view me as defending porn for minors, or being perverted myself, but it's in fact just about upholding my personal right to freely and anonymously navigate the free web. The kids who want to will always find a way to get the access, so it's not at all going to accomplish what they claim it will accomplish. The most ironic part is I actuallyin a sensebelieve that a digital ID can actually solve many issues in society, and a social credit scorecouldactually clean up some social dumpster fires we have in society today; but theremustbe boundaries, there is a fine line between helping and having control in this predicament. The bottleneck is always humans, humans are flawed, and can lie, and can obfuscate, and manipulate, and change their mind, and take, and the list goes on. Humans can be horrible people, and the problem is that the better humans typically don't want the job of leading a country because they know better."
1bzv0yb,onguardforthee,reinKAWnated,"And most saliently, it will be used as a cudgel to stifle and further oppress marginalized groups like the LGBTQ+ community and sex workers.Our Conservatives will do their damndest to follow suite with their southern counterparts (who they envy) and start with ""porn"" in the commonly-understood sense, and very quickly start decreeing that anything to do with queer people/identities is *also* ""porn"" or ""adult materials"", and try to crack down on educational resources and even just ""media that has queer characters in it"" in a direct attack on free speech.Because that's what this is really about."
1bzv0yb,onguardforthee,[deleted],The government needs to stop wasting time and resources on garbage like this. Let individuals take care of protecting their own children. It is impossible to enforce on every porn site on the internet anyway. The government is not supposed to act as a moral police.
xvxdka,onlyfansadvice,baby_milf,"Is this for OnlyFans or something unofficial like Snapchat/Dropbox etc?It‚Äôs a BIG risk to take on, as esm11111 said they either need to go through an approved site that takes responsibility for age verification or they have to be able to ID themselves. It‚Äôs just not worth the risk IMO."
xvxdka,onlyfansadvice,[deleted],"Well for both, but now that I know about the OF side I just want to make sure I‚Äôm being safe on other platforms. I get most money from SnapChat honestly bc people don‚Äôt want to sub to OF. So far it‚Äôs been mostly older guys and I‚Äôm seeing their face. But I‚Äôm starting to get a lot of adds. I‚Äôm starting a monthly rate and verification to filter the excess out."
xvxdka,onlyfansadvice,esm11111,They either use an approved platform (OF or Fansly etc) or they show there face and ID. Otherwise you gotta assume it‚Äôs a horny 14 year old scamming you.
xvxdka,onlyfansadvice,[deleted],I heard from a few people that OF doesn‚Äôt verify age if you‚Äôre not a seller.
xvxdka,onlyfansadvice,the_wife_experience,"Hi! I know this is an old question, but I have a paid page and I want to fulfill some offsite requests, however, I was hoping to use OF as a way to age verify. If I have a trial link to my paid page, will it still require the user to age verify (if their new to OFs of course)?"
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,Open-Palpitation-284,"That's all fine and dandy, but how the f*ck am I supposed to verify my f*cking age if my front camera is BROKEN and I CAN'T F*CKING USE THE BACK ONE FOR F*CK'S SAKE !!!!!! I've been trying to verify my age for HOURS."
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,Savings-Code-069,"Thank you, mine is fucked too and I wish I can just pass that bullshit"
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,ImpressiveService777,Can anyone confirm that this verification is 100% legit? I just don‚Äôt wanna get my personal info stolen.
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,Such_Bunch_5629,Wait so you after you verify the account it automatically gets sent to OF to verify even if you are done it says you weren‚Äôt verified

Unless I find a way to levitate my passport in front of me, they will have to put up with my fingertips covering the edges. 7th attempt failed. I have emailed support twice now. If they can't help, I'll give up.I totally get the reasoning behind how strict they must be, but I dunno, maybe they should get humans to verify instead of AI... A human wouldn't reject my application."
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,SpartanMeatCutter,Dude I'm not seeing this anywhere. I just subscribed to an onlyfans and I'm in Texas. I totally forgot about this stuff. Its only good for 24 hours. I'm looking on the mobile website. Can someone please tell me where to go.

14u2p1m,paypigsupportgroup,alleriamystic,It's good that you make an effort to check. Some don't and it's gross and creepy.
14u2p1m,paypigsupportgroup,giahoney,"Even the submissive person isnt asking for an age verification I am making sure that as a seller I have everything ready for a proof of identity/age. Yeah, the ID thing its not a thing as its weird to spread your Id over the internet but if the domme has an age verified site its easy to check up. I wouldnt reccomend you to approach persons that dont have any of those because you either are going to deal with a scammer or an underage person."
14u2p1m,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],Just go on sites that have clear verification. Like Fetlife. No verification? Can DM and ask them to verify with you personally . Still no verification? Find another Domme
14u2p1m,paypigsupportgroup,goddesss_sapphire,She sounds amateur (even tho im fairly new) A real dom should know that they should be age verified and make it easy to see for the sub
14u2p1m,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],Please always check this!!! I was member of a discord server owned and managed by underage girls üòµ‚Äçüí´ of course I reported and left. You can ask for ID with everything blured but the DOB or any website.

14u2p1m,paypigsupportgroup,LadyLilithDeVille,Thats a HUGE yikes. They should already have it posted to their profile. If its not there and you ask for the link and they get pissy /run/

There will be a ""Share"" button on the top of the screen. Asking a sub to use this approach they can send you a link that will reveal only their date of birth. You get to keep a record of the exchange, if you need proof in the future.They can use this to send a proof of age  by email, SMS, telegram, discord etc any platform that supports communication.This way there is no need for screenshots, no crazy photo editing, the result comes straight to you have a record that the age verification stored and if you decide to walk away from Yoti, you can still download your data and walk away."

j4w9ev,PiNetwork,glebary,Everyone is wondering if they can trust Yoti. I wonder if we can trust Pi. Yoti is clearly a professional company designed for identity verification. A little bit of research is enough to trust them. What about Pi? They are the ones receiving documents such as your passport. What guarantee do we have to make sure that data is safe? I can‚Äôt find any information from Pi that indicates that my data is safe. What they should be doing is deleting your data after confirming your identity since they don‚Äôt need it anymore. I just want some sort of confirmation from them that the KYC process is secure.
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,zagabria1,"I've heard that Yoti is only sending confirmation to Pi network that it is a real person behind the Pi account, not all the private data and documents."
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,ProfErick,I think it's safe.  I've had to provide the same info for buying crypto and signing up for financial  accounts.  They seem to have a good reputation.
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,LunaProjectCrypto,"In my opinion..I do not trust the Pi Network team or their project. To this date, there isn't much information still on the pi project. I would think a big project like pi would draw alot of attention but I just don't see any evidence of that (on the internet). What turned me off of this project was the implementation of ads.. which seems very sketchy imo for a crypto project."
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,glebary,"I don‚Äôt think that the Pi project has any ill intentions and is genuinely trying to make a new crypto currency. They provide a lot of information but not a lot of action. For someone who doesn‚Äôt understand much about how this project is meant to work, the only progress I see is a number counter and a promise that the number will be worth something eventually. I don‚Äôt see why the ads are at all sketchy for two reasons. Youtube isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsketchy‚Äù for having ads. A LOT of people use ads to make revenue and I simply don‚Äôt see why Pi can‚Äôt do the same. The other reason is that, unlike nearly all sources of advertising out there, you can turn it off. Why would they add that option unless they are trying to build trust with their users? Why go through the effort of building trust if they don‚Äôt intend on a professional project?Personally I hope this project succeeds and if ads increase the chance of success then I‚Äôm happy with it. If this is some sort of cash grab (which is highly unlikely for many reasons) then so be it. Being a skeptic isn‚Äôt going to help in any way if that is the case. They won‚Äôt magically change their mind. Being optimistic and helping the project is the best option here.The only thing I am concerned with is their ability to pull this off. Good intentions are not near enough to make sure that we end up with a new functioning crypto currency. They talk a lot about WHAT they want to achieve and not HOW they are going to achieve it. Maybe its a secret so that no one steals their idea. Maybe the project is too ambitious. All we can do is wait patiently and keep pressing that button every 24 hours."
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,EAYSON24,A data breach is inevitable. Who knows what they doin with our info. We do know our data is worth more than this project.
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,wk8x,If your worried about data breaches a Microsoft or google would be a lot worse as they have way more personal info on you
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,koenigsburg-20,"I don't trust it. There are other ways to verify me as a human, and the fact they are using 3rd party apps to have people upload photos of personal information should be a huge red flag. Might as well send that prince in Africa your bank account information üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è...The only companies require by law that needs copies of identification, at least in the United States, is Bank Accounts and Brokerage Accounts. Anything else, you are trusting a unknown company with your identification that they really do not need.BLUF: Don't give your information out. Demand Pi Network to use other verification methods."
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,BlackRadius360,"Good to know I'm not alone.  They invited me to a free KYC slot today, but it's through a 3rd party app.  I've been turned off recently by PI because of all the spammy gaming ads.  I'm not comfortable with biometrics.  For what?  Don't use my images to test your apps.  I don't trust where this ""project"" is going.Haven't seen much that tells me I shouldn't uninstall it and move on.  All you need is my ID for KYC.  If that's not enough than it's your problem."

u8q4ib,PrivacyGuides,infinity-plus,Use apk mirror?
u8q4ib,PrivacyGuides,moneroTrident,"Never experienced that. I just register a new account and set my birthday, and Google never bothers me for age. Does it requires you to provide a credit card? If it is true, buy a burner virtual credit card from black hat world forum, there are a lot of vendors selling it for verification purpose. You can search vcc and find a cheap burner card and buy with crypto. If you are in a hurry I personally recommend vccbaba.com, their credit card quality is good and supports direct monero paymentIf a credit card is not required just find a way to register your account in a country without those age verification restriction bullshit and set you birthday. You might need a clean ip to avoid phone verification, so it is better to have residential proxy than VPN"

13j500w,privacy,KolideKenny,"More experimentally, there are solutions that estimate a user‚Äôs age without an ID. One potential option, which is already used by Facebook and Instagram, would use a camera and facial recognition to guess whether you‚Äôre 18. Another, which is highlighted as a potential age verification solution by France‚Äôs National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL), would ‚Äúguess‚Äù your age based on your online activity.As pointed out by CNIL‚Äôs report on various online age verification options, all these methods have serious flaws. CNIL notes that identifying someone‚Äôs age with a credit card would be relatively easy since the security infrastructure is already there for online payments. But some adult users ‚Äî especially those with lower incomes ‚Äî may not have a card, which would seriously limit their ability to access online services. The same goes for verification methods using government-issued IDs. Children can also snap up a card that‚Äôs lying around the house to verify their age.Similarly, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has expressed concerns about online age verification. In a report it updated in March, the US legislature‚Äôs in-house research institute found that many kids aged 16 to 19 might not have a government-issued ID, such as a driver‚Äôs license, that they can use to verify their age online. While it says kids could use their student ID instead, it notes that they may be easier to fake than a government-issued ID. The CRS isn‚Äôt totally on board with relying on a national digital ID system for online age verification either, as it could ‚Äúraise privacy and security concerns.‚ÄùFace-based age detection might seem like a quick fix to these concerns. And unlike a credit card ‚Äî or full-fledged facial identification tools ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt necessarily tell a site who you are, just whether it thinks you‚Äôre over 18.But these systems may not accurately identify the age of a person. Yoti, the facial analysis service used by Facebook and Instagram, claims it can estimate the age of people 13 to 17 years old as under 25 with 99.93 percent accuracy while identifying kids that are six to 11 years old as under 13 with 98.35 percent accuracy. This study doesn‚Äôt include any data on distinguishing between young teens and older ones, however ‚Äî a crucial element for many young people.Although Yoti claims its system has no ‚Äúdiscernible bias across gender or skin tone,‚Äù previous research indicates that facial recognition services are less reliable for people of color, gender-nonconforming people, and people with facial differences or asymmetry. This would, again, unfairly block certain people from accessing the internet.I know this is a long excerpt, but my goodness. This is bleak."
13j500w,privacy,SootyFreak666,"Biometric age verification can be bypassed with a video and software that allows you to mirror mp4 to webcam.In my option age verification in general should be banned, it unnecessary and no different to a peeping tom. Age verification companies should face the toughest of legal requirements and should be banned from profiting or storing data. The people behind these laws that encourage this online harm should also face legal consequences when it goes up.A politician should be held accountable when peoples IDs or facial scans get posted online, it‚Äôs only fair."
13j500w,privacy,[deleted],"Remember when you were a kid? There was probably a ton of things you weren't allowed to do. And you probably knew a way to get away with doing just about anything on that list. Trying to block kids from accessing sites will make them find ways around it or just make them move to a different site.  I mean, the UK started requiring an ID to watch porn back in 2019. I bet not a single kid there has seen a single nipple since /sBut you're right. It's not the government's job to police our kids, it's the parents."

13j500w,privacy,Frosty-Cell,"There are some fundamental disagreements here. Pre-Snowden, governments used to be able to grab almost all data they wanted, and since VPNs were somewhat rare, they could also get the identity of most users. But that changed with ""going dark"", which has two components - encryption and anonymity (VPNs). They are using children as a tool to try to fix both, but the ""problem"" is entirely unrelated to children.If age (ID) verification becomes a thing, people will move to TOR or similar."

1bhhc5v,privacy,JohnSmith---,"This may sound crazy but I don't think any of these 3rd party identity verification services are actually doing any verifying. Let me clarify. If my name is John Smith and I have an ID that says I'm John Smith, how will they verify the authenticity unless this supposed public/private for-profit company has real-time access to government databases? They can't.They're not doing ID verification, they're doing human verification. Anti scam, anti money laundering. All they want to see is a real human being, live on cam, so they know they're not dealing with a bot. One of my friends is using an ID that is almost a decade old, the photo isn't even visible anymore, yet the verification selfie video in which he held the ID next to his face, was accepted and his account was verified.They're probably also doing 3D face scanning to store and sell to data brokers."
1bhhc5v,privacy,Spoofik,"Yes, you are absolutely right, that's how they work, they have no way to verify anything as there can be no legal access to government data, it's a legalized biometric scam, you can have a lot of problems after leaks from such companies."

With regard to the selfie, I had an experience a week ago where I was asked to do another selfie verification. I got pissed so what I did was I wore a wig and eyeglasses and put face paint.  It was not accepted. So my hypothesis is, they have counterchecked my newest selfie with the previous life selfies I they have asked from me.  I assume there is a data base.

So as far as I can tell, at most they are checking the alpha numeric id data is legit, a visual check that the ID doesn‚Äôt look bogus and it‚Äôs physically there, that the headshot on the ID matches the person in the live selfie and that presentation attack methodologies such as deepfake, masks etc aren‚Äôt present in the live selfie. There might also be some level of device fingerprinting analysis too.

Not in those direct words I will say, but something that let's people easily check and verify a persons age without ever touching any other part of their identity or being able to track them in any way, kind of like a key that only unlocks a chunk of the information and only that information, never anything more."

Skype had the voice quality of two cans with a string, and Teamspeak and Mumble presented significant hurdles for those not technically inclined.Discord sounded way better and even the most doesn't understand a file browser user could get a server hosted for them and their friends for free.Forums? Well you have to spend a lot of money maintaining those and know how to host a website, so that was an easy replace.Fileshare? Easier to drop a file onto the discord app and have everyone in the server have access compared to other cloud solutions that require access perms and cut off access to popular files.Matchmaking? Well when you can join a server that's full of users that's not limited to one specific game or platform and has better ""discovery"" yeah. That's getting replaced.So yes, it replaced everything by being so easy (and free) to use that it's shortcomings are completely overlooked."

1h5qqbg,VRchat,ZeakNato,great news for people that don't like ban evaders
1h5qqbg,VRchat,Shadowmirax,I though they were deleting your information 30 days after you verify? How will they know that an ID has been used twice after those 30 days when they can no longer see what ID the first account used?
1h5qqbg,VRchat,IkouyDaBolt,It is possible they could hash the information and use a bit of salt. ¬†The same information resubmitted would generate the same hash but would not contain anything more than a string of letters and numbers.

1hehgro,VRchat,Polar_Bean,"Not vrc, but in a discord I had with nsfw channels, when someone requested access, I'd send a picture of a floppy disk and ask them to identify what was in the picture. If they said it was the save icon, I knew they were under 18."

1hehgro,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,Genius xD
1hehgro,VRchat,Mentally-Ill-Ladybug,"Like other comments said, depends on the group. Most sfw bar groups and such just ask for DOB at the door and use the honor system, but most NSFW clubs (like lap dance clubs) use discord to ID verify people before they're let into the event, which ik sounds sketch but imo it's better than finding out ur stripping for a minor ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
1hehgro,VRchat,Aggravating-Wafer-32,"I asked one guy how old he was and he said, ""Eighteen?"". I had my doubts and asked what year he was born. He responded with, ""I think I've made a big mistake "" and disappeared."
1hehgro,VRchat,UwU_Incognitus,"Guess what, they normally just use the same method. Ask people for their age, there are some groups that use a discord bot or other websites a person can use to verify their actual ID card to get into group private instances. Some just have a guy who runs the group, askes people for their ID in a Discord DM, the sketchiest way of doing it."
1hehgro,VRchat,SansyBoy144,"I‚Äôm not a group mod, but as someone who erp‚Äôs with a lot of people, often who I‚Äôll meet that day, I can share my many methods. In no particular order.I always start by checking their bio, not just for age, but also seeing if their bio checks out. While this is never 100% I have no issues being wrong about assuming someone who puts Roblox in their bio is underage.Start a conversation about jobs. Even an adult who has never had a job will have something to say about this, and honestly this is a super easy way to discern between the two. It‚Äôs not just about them having or not having a job, but any adult knows what I mean when I say you can tell who is a child or an adult based on how they talk about jobs. This is by far the best piece of advice I have on figuring it out. Us adults come across the conversation all the time, and kids will rarely talk about it.College is another talking point, although I don‚Äôt always do this one, I prefer talking about jobs.Judging based off of voice is never perfect, but can be helpful. Yes there‚Äôs some adults who sound like children and a lot of children who sound like adults, never rely on this on its own, but use this with the others. Like if there‚Äôs someone who sounds like a kid, has a bio that says he loves fnaf and Roblox, and didn‚Äôt seem to relate to having a job, I‚Äôm immediately saying that‚Äôs a kid.Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask questions. I always ask for Age. Which sometimes they will lie, and expect that if they are a kid then they will lie. But it helps to double check. Also if they say they are 18, or even 19, I honestly just wouldn‚Äôt touch it unless you‚Äôre also around that age. But if you are, one thing I used to ask when I was 20 was if they are still in highschool. Often times they‚Äôll answer truthfully and I think everyone agrees that even doing stuff with an 18 yo in hs is weird and creepy.Obviously this is not perfect. Which is why if you are not 100% sure, then don‚Äôt do anything, it‚Äôs not worth it. But there are times when you can be 100% sure. And these can help you get there."
1hehgro,VRchat,Cinnaki,"I also have a series of seemingly random questions I ask that sometimes help. First one I ask is who were the presidential candidates the first time you voted. Not who you voted for, just who they were. But a lot of the questions center around subjects you already talked about. I agree, talking about jobs is the best way I've been able to be more confident a person who sounds young is an adult."
1hehgro,VRchat,josephlucas,We just ask people. If they say they are 18+ we believe them. We have a small chill group so it hasn‚Äôt been a problem.
1hggyto,VRchat,KingSlayer05,"Curious why there's an option for Verified VS Verified 18+ if you arent going to hide the badge? I thought you had to be 18 to play VRChat but I might be wrong lmao.But yeah, looking forward to more instances with less racist-ass screeching kids!"
1hggyto,VRchat,Cinnamonbaar,"I think people under 18 can be age verified, just not 18+. Vrchat is 13+, I think, but still I'm not sure why there needs to be a 13-18 verified. Maybe to make sure they're not a bot?"
1hggyto,VRchat,BiploarFurryEgirl,You can be 13 on VRC
1hggyto,VRchat,zig131,"VRChat is officially 13+A 17 year old could get Verified now, and when they turn 18 they will get the ability to show the 18+ badge."
1hggyto,VRchat,Central_Fire154,"Congrats! I did mine a bit ago, I dont get to see it on my profile until I get home sadly."
1hggyto,VRchat,the_unknow990,Howmm Do u get like an email or something???
1hggyto,VRchat,Cinnamonbaar,"I happened to be in a group that had signed up for the age verification beta, then I clicked a link in that group's discord which led to the vrchat site, which let me press a button to send me an email and verify. So definitely check all of your group's discords!"
1hggyto,VRchat,PrincessRabbitChan,How did you do that??
1hggyto,VRchat,PlayfulParticular402,How?? I been searching on the internet for the past 2 day
1hggyto,VRchat,SuspiciousPrimary758,How to do this on quest?
1hgk7h6,VRchat,bunnythistle,Now stop clogging my homepage with screenshots of your badge >:VI legitimately don't understand why we need five different threads announcing that Age Verification is here. The first thread seemed adequate enough.
1hgk7h6,VRchat,MuuToo,Everyone thinks they‚Äôre the first and are excited about it. Give it a week or so.
1hgk7h6,VRchat,MuuToo,"For me, the online personal privacy ship sailed off long ago. Obviously I implore everyone to take whatever precautions they need to feel safe. But like, Google, Meta, Apple, and so many other companies have so much data on me that for me, another company that seemingly had a pretty good track record isn‚Äôt gonna be the hill I die on."
1hgk7h6,VRchat,ScienceAndLogic-,"i agree, unless your some super rich private celeb, using anything on the internet will most likely cause your information to be somewhere you dont like or want it to and atp we cant really control that unless u live like a hermit"
1hgk7h6,VRchat,SpectorEscape,"I will note so many companies have had lawsuits in Illinois because of their extremely strict laws on keeping info like that. I have a family member who has gotten a good amount of class action money due to it. Target has gotten sued, companies that use biometrics to get into work have gotten sued etc etc"
1hgk7h6,VRchat,Loc5000,your state issue ID Number gives access and information that you can't get with just a name and address. Facebook doesn't even have that info. Most businesses don't. The VRChat devs dont' have any malicious reasons for the info but its still something you should be cautious about. Plus its not hard to hop onto an already verified account via family or friends and still be under 18. So this will make it harder but not impossible
1hgk7h6,VRchat,Toklankitsune,yes but at that point it's easy to prove the minor is the one in the wrong and protects the adults in the room from legal ramifications that can arise from a minor being in spaces they don't belong in. Which is the whole point of this age verification thing.
1hgk7h6,VRchat,AmazingPomegranate83,Anyone who pays for VRC+ has already given away their name and address. I don't see the same people complaining about that?
1hgk7h6,VRchat,BUzer2017,"We give that to Steam, not to VRChat"
1hgk7h6,VRchat,_Pendragon,"Another really good point! If your banking info is already tied to your VRC account, most of the data you'd be worried about getting leaked is already right there."
1hgv7hj,VRchat,GlitchPhoenix98,Hey it's my turn to post about it! Check the wait-list and wait your turn!
1hgv7hj,VRchat,PinkLithium,Wooot Woot
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Foxyr_,"We need more post! Ppl must know that I got age verified! Its not like half of playerbase will be in a few weeks lmaoThen we also need the other side of hating on it!Jokes aside, its really great that we got age verifications, yet I do wanna know what is the ""minimum requied"" data they use to generate the hash they are going to store. (they didnt specify)"
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Maverick23A,guys i've tried creating an account on the persona website and calling their number but they won't return my calls or emails what do i do??? /s
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Pokabrows,"Right now you need to be in one of the groups involved in the early roll out and click a link they give you (likely in their discord). Otherwise you'll just need to be patient, it's not out to everyone yet."
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,"You got it, gonna do some more"
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Kitsune257,"My main question is what is really the use of age verification? I‚Äôm not really in public worlds, and I don‚Äôt ever engage in NSFW stuff. So not exactly sure why at least in my case I would have to do age verification."
1hgv7hj,VRchat,CommunicationSad6246,The age verification is for group 18+ worlds not public since 18+ content is not ment to be in the public‚Äôs
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Background_Fudge_798,anyone got any groups with this verification that still have slots?
1hi3l5p,VRchat,LegallyRegarded,"i mena, i guess you'd have to talk to VRC mods jsut like you would any other time youd get banned. The only thing the 18+ verification would stop you from doing is making another acount and verifying again, which I think is a good thing, because that means people who are verified will be less likley to be shitheads."
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Careful-Kiwi9206,"no because i literally got banned a month or so ago for client modifications, i don‚Äôt even have a pc AND I DONT KNOW HOW TO USE CLIENTS üò≠üò≠(i tried to appeal it and i never got a response)"
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Hades6578,"I was banned for a similar reason, no response other than the instant deny I got for the first one. It‚Äôs not just you and I‚Äôm worried that this may be due to mods power tripping."
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Artificial_Lives,This is a positive.If you get banned and deserve it im glad you'll be locked out of verification if you make a new account.If banned and didn't deserve it you appeal it just like you do now .The only reason I see people annoyed by this is if they want to be shitty and just make new accounts
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Hades6578,I mean if their appeal system actually worked and they didn‚Äôt turn down submissions with robots‚Ä¶
1hi3l5p,VRchat,IkouyDaBolt,"If banned and didn't deserve it you appeal it just like you do now .Over the past 20 years, I've played a handful of various video games.  Whether it be virtual pet sites, MMORPGs, FPSes...The issue persists where an actor can craft enough inquiries and the account is locked.  We're in 2024, we shouldnotbe having to worry about it.  World of Warcraft currently has this issue.If it were something like a temporarily lock on an account until an actual human reviews the data and decides appropriately on the user's behalf that's one thing.  As it stands, needing users to jump through hoops could easily be utilized to put more strain on VRChat's staff than they already have.Aside: I had an Apple account deactivated for a similar reason.  Imagine having a disabled iPhone for 24 hours."
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Hades6578,"I got falsely banned before the age verification bit, they‚Äôre continuing to ignore me, I need to get through to them because it was very wrong"
1hi3l5p,VRchat,XxXlolgamerXxX,"The thing is: that also can happen even without verification, a lot of people dont have the posibility to change hardware or ip. So is the same imo. Also Persona and VRChat dont store personal data after the verification, just the date of birth and a hash, using another method of verification in theory would generate another hash."
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Acceptable-Bat-9577,I‚Äôd be more concerned by the fact that this Persona company is currently facing a massive lawsuit for misusing personal data for their own profit and benefit.
1hi3l5p,VRchat,[deleted],That's not what the lawsuit is about. It's a suit from Illinois (a state with some of the most strict data laws) that is stating Persona has stored data without the proper channels of consent of that data being stored.
1i0701o,VRchat,AdeonWriter,"Even more hilarious is after you have the official 18+ badge on your profile.I heard this exchange with a very old man voice, that shouldn't have even been asked in the first place:""Look at my profile. I'm officially age verified with VRChat.""""We don't trust that, they use an untrustworthy website to age verify, you have to tell us your birthday""""So let me get this straight, you don't trust a website that asks for my ID, but you're ok with me just saying some numbers to you without proof?""They then banned him."
1i0701o,VRchat,ItsYaBoyBackAgain,"This has happened to me at a few places too. I say the same thing too, about how silly it is to not trust the official badge over asking for age and date of birth which is very easily exploitable. Never works, insta ban every time lol. I think those people are a bit too addicted to the small feeling of power and authority they get when age verifying people."
1i0701o,VRchat,GentleGesture,"Age verification becomes secondary to making sure you‚Äôre a rule follower. Will you comply and work with the current ‚Äúauthority‚Äù smoothly, or will you raise problems and make the job of moderating harder than they want? Also, don‚Äôt mind the 14 yo sounding girl they rush in behind you, before she could even finish answering the birthday verification question, after she stuttered out a fake birthday she wasn‚Äôt confident in. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good, you can go.‚Äù"
1i0701o,VRchat,AmazingPomegranate83,They are rolling out 18+ verified badges soon for public release so asking for age and DOB should become a thing of the past with adult-only instances (not to mention it's unreliable).
1i0701o,VRchat,Pokabrows,So far even with the verified badges I've still had to say my age and birthday because supposedly kids are getting their parents to verify accounts.The thing is I feel like it's easier to lie about your age and birthday than the verification thing.Sure some kid may have convinced a parent to verify but uh anyone can figure out a birthday and age.
1i0701o,VRchat,PlushySnake,"If the dumbasses don't trust the ID verification badge, it is better to leave the world imo. Their excuse stating that it is easy for kids to get that verification is lying and it doesn't hold fruit when they trust someone to verbally say their age instead lol.People who do this are power tripping when they could easily allow the verified 18+ badge users inside."
1i0701o,VRchat,charlieblood_8,"Those must be group public, not public instances. If an 18+ group is hosting, then they might ask you your age. I'm age verified but still have people ask for my age since it is not mainstream for now.Edit: And there is usually a bell to notify the staff if there is a barrier to let you in."
1i0701o,VRchat,Hellzer0,"honestly i dont like it either, but its either this or every public world would just be like a daycare since most of the player base is now a 5 year old on quest...tho there are some group publics that dont directly ask you but will kick annoying kids whenever they find them, which seems a bit less awkward."
1i0701o,VRchat,Adventurous-Gold-964,I got kicked from blackcat  said am 32 was kicked
1i0701o,VRchat,Silly-Problem-2836,I'm 33 and every time someone demands my age and date of birth I just tell them to eat my ass. I'm so fed up of it.
1icgnpg,VRchat,dandy443,"It‚Äôs just early access people. They can‚Äôt just dump it at once and either cause issues on the other companies server, or it could cause financial damages. Since they are paying for the service themselves. If anything this likely means it will be out in general soon.Plus imho limiting it to groups was dumb, as most of those were not going to distance themselves from their audience for a test."
1icgnpg,VRchat,RadElert_007,"Hijacking the top comment because some people here are straight up spreading misinformation about age verification being ""paywalled"" or VRC+ exclusive.Please see the below from the official VRChat twitter.https://x.com/VRChat/status/1884393142293573764Its not gonna be a VRC+ exclusive feature. It never was going to be a VRC+ exclusive feature and if you watched their videos on the topic. You'd know that.They did the same thing with the Android client roll out."
1icgnpg,VRchat,saikouyua,I am so appreciative of this feature. I often find myself annoyed and wanting to get away from the kids but find very few monitored lobbies and when I do find them I‚Äôm often mistaken as a child due to my voice. Can‚Äôt wait to see how the how age verification possibilities in game play out.
1icgnpg,VRchat,SmallTownLoneHunter,shouldnt age verification be a basic feature in this game?
1icgnpg,VRchat,ancoigreach,"It will be. I feel like a broken record at this point, but as I say pretty much every time I visit this sub, Age Verification is in testing, the plan was always to roll it out slowly, it is not fully implemented yet."
1icgnpg,VRchat,[deleted],"It is.Like Android access, it's early access to VRC+ first."
1icgnpg,VRchat,sesor33,It costs VRChat money every verification they do. The cost of your VRC+ subscription is offsetting it
1icgnpg,VRchat,Ambitious_Singer5519,Yes
1icgnpg,VRchat,NessieNep,Afaik VRC are the only ones pay walling ID verification in this manner.Roblox doesn't do this (they also use Persona btw).Neither does Fetlife.Neither did Second Life when it supported ID verification afaik.I really hope this is temporary like a lot of people are getting the impression of and it just becomes a basic feature for everyone eventually.Edit: What I fear is that other companies that don't paywall ID verification might start doing so if they think they can get away with it.
1icgnpg,VRchat,Breaker1ove,where do you find this?
1iefs5f,VRchat,Eternal_Ohm,"Yes you keep it, this is stated on their blog.https://hello.vrchat.com/blog/age-verification"
1iefs5f,VRchat,Darkstone_BluesR,Thanks!
1iefs5f,VRchat,AryaDRed,"Yep, if you dont have vrc+ but got age verified from the group drop you also still have it"
1iefs5f,VRchat,BlizzrdSnowMew,"Yes but I used it as an excuse to finally actually use VRC+.  I'm not sure if I'll use any of the other features, but I spend so much time in VRC I think it's time I finally start supporting them lol"
1iefs5f,VRchat,nesnalica,i dont understand why so many randomly assume itll disappear if you don't have vrc+lol
1iefs5f,VRchat,Darkstone_BluesR,Been on VRC for little over a month. It is completely normal to ask questions about things you do not know.
1iefs5f,VRchat,PonyUpDaddy,"Man, they really monetized 18+ content and I find it hilarious this question comes up a lot"
1iefs5f,VRchat,tailslol,"Yes ,they plan to release it to free users at a later date"
1iefs5f,VRchat,KeyboardHaver,"That is not guaranteed, actually. On their developer update they mention the following.How Age Verification works could change in the future. It might be tied to VRC+ forever‚Ä¶ or maybe it isn‚Äôt tied to anything at all. We don‚Äôt know yet and so we‚Äôre leery about making any absolute statement.https://ask.vrchat.com/t/developer-update-30-january-2025/40905Their blogpost meanwhile seems to hint at this only being temporary.From what I gathered, theywantto make it free, but may not have the ability to do so due to it costing money for them."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,Capable-Trip-4423,"sounds like some idiot at the bar world still wanting to flex their only modicum of power and still ask for IDs. I don't know any way it can be bypassed in this way, and it's likely a lie to still ask for your ID and stuff."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,Sheimusik,kinda stupid that they say age verification isn't valid when someone can literally just lie about their age vocally and that somehow works for them like bruh
1iuaj4z,VRchat,blueskyredmesas,Virtual bouncers aren't beating the allegations.
1iuaj4z,VRchat,LimitAffectionate266,"I literally always  say ""11th of september 2001"" anytime im asked my dob and not once has anyone batted an eye, i think only once did I hear a bouncer go ""wait wtf"" after he already let me through, they literally dont care or double check, its all about the power trip for them"
1iuaj4z,VRchat,Mr_SunnyBones,"Hey , some of us actually DO have Sep 11 as a birthday , admittedly I was in my 20s when the towers fell."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,RadElert_007,"No, they arent. Bar bouncers just wanna big dick and still feel important."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,justsmokeweedkids,"I feel like people that claim the bypassing stuff are ignorant of the actual verification process. You literally have to scan each side of your face along with your license. Unless you‚Äôre a clueless/unconscious/intoxicated parent or adult, I just don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs possible for a minor to successfully pull off considering the requirements. Getting ahold of an account that‚Äôs already been verified is more realistic tbh. Even then, that‚Äôs hardly an excuse to disregard verified users as a whole. Shit, even getting age verification for IMVU has less requirements than VRC."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,VioViridian,"This sounds like a load of horseshit that bouncers tell themselves so they can power trip. I age verified my account and it would be harder for a kid to get through. Unless they can steal an id, have the adult be intoxicated or unconscious somehow, there isn‚Äôt a good way of getting around it. The alternative is kids buying age verified accounts, which wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it was happening."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,MuuToo,No. They get some weird power trip from being an inconvenience and forcing you to stop for 'em.
1iuaj4z,VRchat,Tyrilean,How is you telling them a date going to be more secure than the actual verification?
1j03tol,VRchat,zig131,"A really nonchalant/oblivious/shitty parent could let a child scan thier ID and face ü§∑ . Or I guess they could pay another adult, but each ID is one time use.No system is 100% foolproof.However if the child was exposed to anything, that would be 100% on the parent and VRC would not be liable as they have done due diligance.But generally these people still asking for age without checking for the badge first are on an ego trip, and think they have some kind of super voice age detection powers."
1j03tol,VRchat,Boney_McBonerton_YT,"Honestly I was heavily picking up an power trip vibe from the guy checking users, I just didn't bring it up in case someone got their undies in a twist."
1j03tol,VRchat,turtledude01,"This right here.  Any group or club in vrchat declining to accept the vrchat proven age verification is actually putting the liability of allowing an underage person on themselves.  If a user is verified illegitimately they can also be banned and the ID will never be usable again (might be wrong on this but it's highly likely to be true).  Anyone either asking for age and DOB or asking you to join a discord and ID/ FACE verify instead of trusting the vrchat system (trust but verify, I've still ask just age) is simply believing they are a better judge of real/ fake IDs than any legitimate iD system."
1j03tol,VRchat,TheShortViking,"How the fuck do they think asking people their age is better? If someone gets past the verification then of course they are going to lie about their age. How dense are these bouncers?Like is this how they think its going to go?""Hey how old are you?""""I'm verified""""I don't trust the shitty verification, answer the question!""""Ohh, yea I'm 15"""
1j03tol,VRchat,Skylar_Drasil,"They are extremely dense, I legit used the VRC chatbox to say ‚ÄúI already verified‚Äù once, they said they didnt trust it, so I told them what they wanted (also through the chatbox) and they let me through. Legit double standard there"
1j03tol,VRchat,pinkiceygirl,Truly there is no winning with these people and I largely suspect a lot of them just wish to power trip. I‚Äôd rather believe an ID system over someone just blurting an age they memorized to get in. (basically the equivalent of clicking ‚Äúyes I‚Äôm 18‚Äù on adult sites) are these systems fool-proof? No but it is so much better than what we had considering people begged for this to be in place.
1j03tol,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,"Oh yes, but asking the age is 100% safe. Like we live in a world where lying will kill you right? Nobody lies about it for sure..."
1j03tol,VRchat,cgsimo,"Its just dumb bouncers thinking they are special. Even if age verification was not fool proof, which it probably isn't 100%, its still a lot more reliable than just asking. Like anyone can just lie. If someone doesn't recognize my age verification and insist on me giving my DOB I just leave the instance."
1j03tol,VRchat,Korteck,"Anyone who thinks asking someone their age is somehow more secure than someone submitting government ID and a facial scan is a moron and probably just wants to power trip. I've told my actual birthrate to these bouncers maybe twice ever. I've told them I was born in 1955, and no one bat an eye.Could some kid trick their parents to get verified? Yeah probably. Are the VAST majority of verified people actually 18 or over? Yes.Verification is 100% more reliable than just asking someone their age and hoping they're telling the truth."
1j03tol,VRchat,drksolrsing,"If you find people that are saying this, screen record them saying it, and send it to VRC.The only way to fully battle kids skirting the system is to blow their legs out from under them. The account will be banned and the ID will not be able to be used in VRC anymore.It's very easy.For the large number of people who have absolutely seen kids circumvent it, not a person has actual proof of this."
1jme0ir,VRchat,metroidmen,"Yeah, I agree. It‚Äôs usually a power trip.With that said, if we REALLY want to think about it, tons of users record and/or stream their game. So when someone walks up and gives their literal date of birth with their username, who knows what doxxing rabbit hole that could lead to."
1jme0ir,VRchat,No-Reality-2744,"Yeah it was always a risk to wave your DOB around public instances. They aren't protecting people by asking this, if we claim to be an adult that is the same as hearing us say whatever year makes us 18 anyway. If they don't believe us claiming to be an adult why would they believe whatever date we slap in their faces? It's stupid and it's like talking to a wall to even try asking how it actually helps. The best they can say is ""we are just doing what we can"" when it isn't doing ""what you can"" when the doing does not actually result in a safer environment. They're just saying that to convince themselves they're not wrong."
1jme0ir,VRchat,FlexiCake,Exactly why I don't give out my DOB or age online. VRChat is just another online social media platform to me despite being a different style.I'm also a Vtuber so I gotta be careful to try and conceal my identity the best I can.
1jme0ir,VRchat,chunarii-chan,Most of the people that do this are underage themselves. As an adult I have no problem immediately identifying other adults. Adults don't do what they do. And I am not giving out my fucking information to random children on the internet when I could just be making it up anyway. Also I am 18+ verified. I can't remember the last time I saw an age gated instance except for the American eboy h party group who always have one
1jme0ir,VRchat,Helioskull,"It is EXCLUSIVELY a power trip now, the point has been driven home over and over, and it'll be driven home even more until the point is somehow managed to be driven to them. If you cannot trust a ID matched to selfie verification, you don't want verification, you just want the ability to stop people and make them do what YOU want."
1jme0ir,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,"Damn people you are so unlucky or I was so lucky? Had this situation only once.If you do an 18+ instance and want to gate keep it, then allow verified people in. So simple, yet too hard for some people with concrete instead of a brain."
1jme0ir,VRchat,pokemonfan95,Even age verified instances some still ask for dob even tho they use the age verified instance type and say we don't trust age verified system .... then why tf are u using verified 18+ only instance? They ofc try to make the excuse minors can lie on the 18+ verification . they can't spoof or cheat there way past it i swear the groups that do this are stupid power hungry idiots smh possibly there creeps running it who knows
1jme0ir,VRchat,drksolrsing,"They can't get much out of ""41, 83"".That's all I give them because fuck them, my birthday I'll be 42. The day doesn't matter."
1jme0ir,VRchat,LittleChi-,"There's people going as far as opening  ""21+"" instances yet where they give allowance to 18+ if they know people within the group or instance where I'm like ""that must be power tripping"" I couldn't explain it any other way"
1jme0ir,VRchat,mexicandiaper,Yeah as soon as they ask I nope out. I'm trying to relax after work not have a papers please situation from a 22-year-old in a fursona.
1jn475f,VRchat,plantgirl7,If anyone is asking for your date of birth beyond the verification and commenting on your voice at all they‚Äôre on a power trip and you probably don‚Äôt even want to participate in that instance
1jn475f,VRchat,weewoo0333,That makes sense as a lot of them would sit and argue with me which didn‚Äôt make sense cause if you really think I‚Äôm a child why would you argue?
1jn475f,VRchat,Just-Brush399,If they think voice verification is more secure than id verification then those groups probably aren‚Äôt worth your time. There‚Äôs plenty of groups out there specifically for age verified users. Try looking for the groups called ‚Äúage gated‚Äù and ‚Äúage verified‚Äù
1jn475f,VRchat,weewoo0333,Thank you! I had no idea about these groups and defo will check them out :)
1jn475f,VRchat,No-Reality-2744,"I don't trust the groups pretending a voiced DOB is more valid than ID verified as it means they will just trust anyone that claims to be an adult anyway. It doesn't help that I have found out that some groups do indeed ignore the ID verifying so they can let teens pretend to be adults in there. If they ask me for a DOB, it's an instant leave, and with the amount of other people doing the same they will just have to deal with the walkaways. Most nights I can find at least one place that takes my profile as a responsible claim of my age and knows that is already as safe as they are gonna get it, in-game at least."
1jn475f,VRchat,Kymerah_,"It‚Äôs enough to be age verified for normal people, don‚Äôt worry.You don‚Äôt want to be around people who still ask for your DOB, they‚Äôre doing you a favour."
1jn475f,VRchat,Aduritor,"It is enough. The only problem is that the powertripping group moderators had their precious ""age and date of birth"" taken from them, and now are spreading the lie that the age verification is easily bypassed (it is not) to keep feeling in power."
1jn475f,VRchat,Emotional_Fold_2527,call them creepy and find another world tbh
1jn475f,VRchat,zakku_88,"VRC player base: Implement some sort of age verification!VRC: *implements age verification* Alright, here you goVRC player base: No! Not like that!I swear, a lot of these people (bar group owners/staff in particular) don't want actual solutions, but just more of the illusion of having some sort of ""power"" over others smh..."
1jn475f,VRchat,CeriPie,Report them for attempting to solicit personal information. Asking for DoB to participate in an instance when you are age verified is a violation of the privacy section of VRChat's ToS. There should be absolutely no reason anyone should be trying to pry your DoB out of you if you are age verified through VRChat's official system.
1iq1tth,Wetherspoons,Qwerty-03,"No, it's not a legal requirement it's something supermarkets do. Realistically a parent will be buying it for them as under 16s can't be in the pub unaccompanied."
1iq1tth,Wetherspoons,JayRD2002,No legal age limit. Just a recommendation. :)
1iq1tth,Wetherspoons,Strange-Box-8232,Yeah my local supermarkets and poundland ask for ID on energy drinks
1iq1tth,Wetherspoons,Strange-Box-8232,But they'll sell them scissors no questions asked
1iq1tth,Wetherspoons,drunkenangel_99,"in my pub we were told to ask for ID but it was never specified if it‚Äôs a legal requirement for us or noteditwhat‚Äôs the downvotes for, my PM wasn‚Äôt the type of person to question üò≠"
1iq1tth,Wetherspoons,Iamnahnah,Mine too
1iq1tth,Wetherspoons,whatformdidittake,"I was IDed at a Morrisons recently for a Monster, the child in her school uniform buying what could have been a 8 shot  espresso from the in store Costa machine was allowed to make her purchase without any ID check"
1iq1tth,Wetherspoons,daviddawson325,I had this the other day at a hospital all for 1 energy drink I'm 40 ffs

1hy1yeo,youtubedl,500xp1,Hi; suppose I opened cmd at the yt-dlp.exe directory; how would the whole command go (with the firefox cookies)?
onkqyy,youtubedl,pukkandan,"It is already implemented in youtube-dl, but there has been no release with this fix. You'll have to either compile it yourself or install the master with pip+git.You can also check out my forkyt-dlpwhere this fix is available in the release version"
onkqyy,youtubedl,maius-wthns,Cool thanks
onkqyy,youtubedl,WritingReadingReddit,"I switched over to yt-dlp specifically because of the age restricted video issue.Figuring out how to use a cookies file sounds too complicated.And, yeah, even worse is some countries requiring official identification just to see pictures naked girls.Fuck having to give anyone your real name for them to attach to a giant list of everything you've watched while masturbating.You might also consider a VPN so that YouTube and Google don't know you're in a country from which they demand identification.This annoying age and identity restriction is a perfect illustration of why we need this video ripping technology: The rules are always changing, and you never know why or when you won't be allowed to see your favorite video ever again."
onkqyy,youtubedl,q1525882,"Same from EU, Tampermoneky script in browser allows to watch them, but download is quite PITA at the moment. JDownloader2 also complains age. Not sure if my cookies will do the trick.Will try yt-dlp as few persons already mentioned this solution."
onkqyy,youtubedl,svnpenn,Another method is using OAuth. A Go package and command line tool are available here:https://github.com/89z/mech

1dh47f9,youtube,Jumpy-Violinist-6725,"yeah I do not trust any of these options. Granted Google probably has access to all this info already, but I am not giving them that stuff"
1dh47f9,youtube,[deleted],"I don't see that option, maybe you need to start a channel first before seeing it?"
