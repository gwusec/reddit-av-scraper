1jm4enp,adultery,ObsidianDreamsRedux,LOL at the reports of this post being harassment.I guess someone is feeling the heat. 🔥
1jm4enp,adultery,ruspongeworthy25,The men are not okay.
1jm4enp,adultery,Curious_Ad_2492,Why are ~waves hand~men?
1jm4enp,adultery,MadameBananas,These are seriously depressing.

1jm4enp,adultery,Willow8877,The bar is literally so low at this point with some of these ADs. This is so cringe and disturbing 😳 but at least I had a good laugh. Thanks!

1jm4enp,adultery,Proud-Internal-6960,"That last guy.... yeh, he posts ads with 5 different states in title  (that I've noticed so far). Changes up what's in the ad justtttt enough, but they're all him. Under maybe 3-4 different profiles. Yikes. He could travel for work, but I think it's much more likely he's a deceptive creep."
1jm4enp,adultery,SlutForCinnamonRollz,This weeks round up feels extra long and it’s making me extra tired
1f2g0nl,adultwebmastersonly,melsmammal,"The 2257 regulations have not changed for many years, so assuming you've already received appropriate legal advice on the requirements the risk of missing any changes to the law is pretty low. You can also use third party 2257 custodian platforms like2257Sentry.comwhich can help."
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,ExpensiveAd4496,"The most successful hosts are extremely professional like your husband. They quote the rules, their own and AirBnbs, back to customer service. They take steps from the start when there is an issue. There is so much you’ve described that we can all add to our playbook. Thank you."
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,Particular-Try5584,"And a total lack of emotional hand wringing! It’s a business, just get in there and do … business!"
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,rhonda19,You are most welcome. I appreciate the feedback.
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,LacyTing,In what world would any host let people smoke inside?  Was she raised in a barn?
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,ExpensiveAd4496,"This is tough because it’s hard to prove smoking indoors. So many just open a window and smoke away no matter what the rules are. I live above my Airbnb and immediately know. So my rules have become very explicit. If you smoke I will know. Your reservation will be cancelled within the hour. No warnings, no discussion. So if you smoke, go elsewhere. Some read my rules and think the no smokers part is a tad excessive. Fine. Don’t book here. Others read it and book me over anyone else because they know they won’t walk into a place that smells like cigarettes. Win-win."
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,rhonda19,I think she thinks she is rebel of sorts. She arrived in one of those smaller RVs. She could have smoked in it. Just a person who wings it I guess. She asked like 3 times about smoking inside. I stopped answering her messages in the app. Stating the rules show the property entirely smoke free means inside too. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️I read here yesterday or the day before there are some countries where inside smoking is ok.
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,alicat777777,Sounds like your husband handled it perfectly!
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,rhonda19,Thank you.  He does do well this type of thing.
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,flaminghead,Can you share the name of your identity verification/PM API? Thank you!
1hcvq0h,airbnb_hosts,yamakazee,Damn I caught a lot of shit for trying to enforce my rules when I brought it up here earlier this week. Good to hear Airbnb has some sense about this

15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,[deleted],I wouldn’t even asked him for his age if you look the age🤦‍♀️🤷🏽‍♂️.
15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,Zanockthael,"In the UK, not asking for DoB for alcohol, blades or vapes is an instant offboarding offence. Regardless of the age of the person you're delivering too. Asking for the DoB of a 95 year old is pretty silly, if you ask me, but most customers are used to it now.Funny story. When this was first brought in a few years ago, we had to ask for valid ID from everyone, not just the DoB. The AMOUNT of verbal abuse we got from people over 50...That fucking rule was in place for over a year."
15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,[deleted],"Maybe it's a UK thing. You have to ask their birth year, if they are under 25 it asks you to ID them. It's mostly for alcohol"

15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,cyberspace2008,Every now and then this comes up it's just a UK and (I think?) Canada thing. Possibly just UK/Europe where Amazon delivers alcohol.You can buy ethyl alcohol from Amazon US but it's denatured.
15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,Zanockthael,"For the US amoung us, it's purely a UK thing. Not allowed to leave blades, alchohol or vape products with under 18's. But yeah, I've had AVDs that were cable ties (the woman I was delivering to was really abusive towards me about it) and also one that was a frying pan. The couple I delivered it to were confused, but they told me that it was for their teenage son. I told them that I probably needed to ask for ID, because food cooked by a teenager is a lethal weapon. They found it amusing.Also remember one that was a cheese cutting board. I mean, you'd have to try really god damn hard to stab someone with one of those. It'd be more lethal to leave it in the box and hit someone over the head with it.Edit: as an amusing side note, I ordered some *very* sharp whittling knives off Amazon and they weren't AVD, because the blades weren't quite long enough, I guess. Also, chainsaws can be left with under 18's. Go figure.It might be that the charging cable was for vapes. All vape products are age verified."
15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,Crayen5,"Oh if it's for vapes that's understandable, I thought he said it was a phone charger.I've had to ID people for stuff like bread knives and wine labels before, the laws can be quite strict. This one just threw me off a bit.Oddly enough, if you order lighters I don't think those are age verified either?"
15zxj35,AmazonDSPDrivers,deanroy90,It's probably a requirement to avoid failed deliveries and verify the customer!

8u1bas,AmazonFlexDrivers,Lukkypuppy,You do realize YOU can be fined like $5k or more for not verifying age or seeing ID?? I know you have to scan or input the data from the ID into the app (so you have to see it either way to be allowed to accept the drop off). I’m not sure why this is even a question?

15x3smc,amazonprime,LiLiPootHERE,Is this me or anyone else has noticed that Amazon prime customer service has become so poor in responding to questions and resolving simple issues that they must not happen in the first place.
15x3smc,amazonprime,AbcdefG77703,"Amazon is going downhill fast.  They are outsourcing to other countries more now and the other countries aren't aware of the laws and legalities of other countries they deal with.  They seem to have automated responses they are to copy and paste to the chat if you use the chat.  I dont know if you get better luck calling but they always suggest calling or waiting for a call for 24 hours, its like you took my money fast enough now give it back.  They are experiencing a lot of loss with people cancelling Prime becuase Prime is not even honored in shipping anymore.  And with the holiday season and a lot of returns, they are gearing up to fight everyone so they don't have net loss by all the returns that will end up coming after holidays.  Being a Priome member and paying a monthly fee really doesn't have anything to do with helping anyone anymore."

15x3smc,amazonprime,AbcdefG77703,"I can tell you what to do that WILL get you results, NO ID needed, NO arguing with Amazon Associates who are rude most of the time:  Report that you sent a return to the BBB on their websitehttps://www.bbb.org/file-a-complaintand tell them Amazon is not refunding you and that they are requesting outrageous private information from you just to get your refund.  Within a day or 2, the BBB will handle it and you WILL get a response and you WILL get your refund that is due you without having to jump hoops with the Amazon Associates.  I have recently had to do this for an item that was first of all shipped LATE.. 5 days LATE to be exact after I pay for Prime to get it within 2 and the date it said it would be delivered was 2 days not 5 days and then after it was shipped it said delivered but it was not delivered, I did not receive it and they were giving me the runaround another 3 days.  So I went to the BBB website and reported them.  Within 24 hours the BBB got back to me SO DID AMAZON and THEY REFUNDED ME within minutes.  So start reporting them to the BBB, do NOT send your ID to them, they do not need this information to do returns and refunds... They refund back to the source that paid them so there is no reason they need an ID or other information to do a refund, thats ridiculous.  Amazon used to be easy to deal with and a great company but lately it is going down hill.  I'll shop other places instead, I am just trying to use up a gift card so I can get off there agian..."
15x3smc,amazonprime,pornonporno,BBB didn't work for me.
15x3smc,amazonprime,Ok-Vermicelli1655,"Hey so I made a complaint through the BBB and got this response back from Amazon: I am Vishal from Amazon.com. I am writing in response to a complaint filed on your behalf by the Better Business Bureau BBB - I have provided the BBB with a copy of this message.I've reviewed your email regarding an order placed on our website.Upon reviewing I can see that our specialist team needs to verify your identity before we can consider your request for a refund or replacement. We may also request additional information before granting your request.Amazon takes all security-related matters very seriously and your account security is our top priority. We have policies and security measures in place to ensure that your personal information remains secure.Once submitted, our team will review and get back to you with an update on refund for the mentioned order.I have also forwarded a relative feedback to our business team regarding your experience and they will be reviewing this further.However, we won't be able to provide any further information apart from this.I hope this helps! Have a great week ahead!I have never returned anything to Amazon apart from this so I don’t understand what security they’re talking about. I also don’t feel comfortable providing my ID to them. Any ideas of what I should do?"
15x3smc,amazonprime,Flat-Ad-8254,"This “new” policy is exploiting Amazon customers. #1 they don’t send out an email to inform you they need additional documentation because they are hoping you don’t bug them about it and they keep the item and your money. #2 Even if you already sent the item (mine was an $1100 item) back to them, they indicated in the email they do send upon calling, that if you don’t send an ID you forfeit your right to be eligible for a refund (and the item you already return I presume) but that you are able to continue using your account. So, if this were truly about potential fraud, why would they allow you to continue using your account as normal? It seems to me that the only fraud happening here is that Amazon is getting greedy, keeping the return item and money of many unsuspecting customers who don’t know to call and hassle them. I say this is a class action law suit. If anyone is interested in starting that up you have my time energy and effort to help it come to fruition."
15x3smc,amazonprime,ExistingAsparagus180,"I was waiting for someone to jump start a lawsuit! I had ordered an item and it came used. I requested a replacement and it was delivered. I took the item to UPS and got a receipt. The receipt doesn’t show a tracking number. Instead, it says “contact Amazon.” I had returned two other replacements because they were either used or broken and had received an email stating that my return was complete. However, on the other items, it’s still showing as “replacement ordered” so I decided to chat with a rep. The first one couldn’t help me for whatever reason so I was transferred. I told the person who I was transferred to my reason for the chat and this person went on to ask which item because there are many.. umm… first of all, I shop on Amazon a lot purely for its comvience and second, it’s not my fault they send out used and broken items. Anyway… The person I was transferred to kept insisting that I would get a refund when my item is received. I kept telling this rep that I wasn’t asking for a refund. I was asking if the item was received by Amazon because I have no way of tracking it (no tracking number is provided). Rep then checked and said there’s a carrier delay. I said ok thanks. - that’s all I wanted to know. Then this pos proceeds to tell me that they aren’t a carrier and that I need to contact UPS. I then asked how is UPS going to help if no tracking number is listed? Crickets! I exited the chat and then I see the email that everyone else is getting. I’m down to sue Amazon. Not only does asking for personal information sound shady, I can almost guarantee that their drivers are stealing packages from one particular warehouse. I had ordered the same item twice because the first one was considered “lost/stolen” as it had been delayed in transit for over a week and the second time I ordered the same item (left the same warehouse as the previous one) was delayed in transit again. It took me 5 tries with 5 different reps to get my refund for it. Mind you, I live in a state where it doesn’t rain nor snow so weather isn’t to blame. Amazon has gotten lazy, greedy and shady with their business practices and I’m getting sick and tired of it. This email was the last straw."

It was purchased from Amazon on Oct 11, 2023.I returned this product with another product in the same box with the same shipping label as per Amazon shipping instructions.While I opened the Amazon shipping boxes to confirm their contents when I received them, none of the product packages were ever opened by me.The other product in the box (RICOH Remote Control TR-1 for Theta Camera) was successfully returned to Amazon and refunded to my credit card account.These products for return were shipped  to Amazon via UPS on Oct 23, 2023 and were delivered to an Amazon facility dock in LAS VEGAS, NV, US on Oct 30, 2023.There is a UPS ""Proof of Delivery"" document available from UPS.I have a photo of both products in the box just before I sealed it and attached an Amazon generated UPS shipping label. I personally delivered this box to my local UPS store and received a receipt from them.On Nov 12, 2023, I called Amazon Customer Support when I discovered that the returned ""TIUIHU Portable Silicone Case for Ricoh Theta Z1 360 Degree Camera"" was still listed as un-returned in my Amazon customer dashboard.While discussing this matter with an Amazon Support person on Nov 12, 2023, I began to suspect that I might be being scammed for personal information.I believe that the Amazon Support person told me that a government issued ID would be required to prove my identity before a return would be initiated.I will not be sending Amazon.com, Inc. proof of my identity in order to obtain my refund.Amazon is engaging in coercive and privacy invasive tactics.If you choose to refuse my request, I will be filing  complaints with the Oregon Department of Justice Consumer Protection department and the US Attorney General.Please initiate my refund immediately.Thank you.My NameMy Amazon Login Name"

vlnb8c,amiugly,Mediocre_Lie_9812,You’re most definitely not ugly and take people overestimating your age as a compliment (older people usually have their shit together) well that and when you get trained to do retail you get told to address people as ma’am and sir

You'll get the 50 cents refunded after 7 days and your credit card information isn't stored, so it's not a scam (but still stupid)."

1k2dw5j,anime_titties,empleadoEstatalBot,"Discord's New Age Verification Requires ID Or Face Scans For Some UsersGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.Discord is experimenting with a new age-verification policy that would require users to prove their age to see material Discord considers harmful. The verification process is currently undergoing trial in the United Kingdom and Australia, though Discord didn't say how long the test period will last or when--or if--it will roll out in other countries.The age verification process applies to all devices, includingDiscord on XboxandPlayStation 5.When a user tries to interact with material that Discord flags with its sensitive media filter, such as potentially explicit images, or tries to change their sensitive media filter settings, a pop-up appears that tells them to verify their age before they can continue. Discord provides two ways to verify: a face scan using your device's camera or using a mobile device to scan an ID card, such as a driver's license. The process reportedly takes just a few minutes, and you receive a direct message from Discord once it's finished that tells you which age group you're in.This system invites privacy concerns, though Discord said in anFAQ sectionabout the new requirement that the data users provide for verification is not stored by Discord or its face-scan vendor. The face scan option is ""on-device,"" which means the vendor doesn't collect or store biometric data. Age verification for Discord is a one-time thing. After the system places a user in a specific age group, that's where they stay until they choose to re-verify. Discord said users can choose to re-verify their age at any time if they believe the system placed them in the incorrect category or, presumably, once they get older and the category no longer applies.If the verification process decides your age category is below the minimum required to have a Discord account, it'll automatically ban you. Banned users will have to file an appeal using Discord's underage appeals process to try reversing the ban.Got a news tip or want to contact us directly? Emailnews at gamespot.comMaintainer|Creator|Source CodeSummoningu/CoverageAnalysisBot"
1k2dw5j,anime_titties,Intense_Judgement,"Yeah I'm not a fan of this one to be honest. Discord shouldn't need to record data about its users even temporarily, it's a chat program.Also, getting automatic banned because the face scanner decides you look too young would be infuriating."
1k2dw5j,anime_titties,Weenaru,I miss the times when you didn’t even need to register an account to use discord.
1k2dw5j,anime_titties,Boner-Salad728,It should scan the bold tip of your head instead of face. I always think of that idea when self-service cashier calls for personnel to confirm my age when I buy alcholol.
1k2dw5j,anime_titties,Miner_239,"And what stops me from scanning my ma's face or ID instead of mine? Will it correctly determine the age of all kinds of people? If it's all in-device, then there's no human review. Better than the privacy hit from actually sending more of your data, but still, this sounds like such a badly implemented idea."
1k2dw5j,anime_titties,jadedflames,"Absolutely nothing. But now it’s your fault, not Discord’s fault.This is an ass-covering move."
1k2dw5j,anime_titties,Unable_Duck9588,"Discord is in danger of getting banned in many places and is already banned in some countries.I imagine they want to avoid that sort of thing. I don’t agree with it either but I’m just saying this is what’s up.I imagine it also opens up possibilities to be prosecuted if you do anything illegal on it, which is rife for abuse."
1k2dw5j,anime_titties,Soepkip43,I hope discord dies! It's cancer for the internet. It gobbles up everything its users feed it to never be seen again.Processing sensitive PII for this is horseshit and they need to find better ways that do not involve collecting sensitive and biometric data.

1k39i0e,anime_titties,empleadoEstatalBot,"Discord Begins Testing Facial Scans for Age VerificationDiscord has begun requiring some users in the United Kingdom and Australia to verify their agethrough a facial scanbefore being permitted to access sensitive content. The chat app’s new process has been described as an “experiment,” and comes in response to laws passed in those countries that place guardrails on youth access to online platforms. Discord has also been the target of concerns that it does not sufficiently protect minors from sexual content.Users may be asked to verify their age when encountering content that has been flagged by Discord’s systems as being sensitive in nature, or when they change their settings to enable access to sensitive content. The app will ask users to scan their face through a computer or smartphone webcam; alternatively, they can scan a driver’s license or other form of ID.Discord is reportedly preparing to go public on the stock market, though those plans may change as the stock market continues to experience tumult amid President Trump’s global trade war. The company brought in more than $600 million in revenue in 2024, according toBloomberg, primarily by upselling users on its Nitro premium service that includes features like custom emoji and larger file upload sizes. The app is popular with gamers but has been criticized as being abrasive and hard to navigate.Both the UK and Australia have moved to impose new restrictions on youth access to online platforms out of fear that they may be harmful to brain development. While many do believe social media, in particular, can have adverse effects on adolescents who are still developing their emotional learning and behavior, teens themselves have reported benefits of social media use, and much research regarding adverse effects remains observational. Schools across the United States have been imposing daylong bans on access to phones, but those moves are also intended to curb distraction.Australia’s outright ban on teenagers under 16 from using social media, set to go into effect by the end of the year, has been criticized over its enforcement mechanism, which requires platforms take “reasonable steps” to prevent underage users from accessing their services. That could come in the form of ID verification, which critics argue is a violation of privacy as it would potentially require all users to hand over sensitive information.Australia’s legislature has some flexibility to choose which platforms are affected, which has caused friction as YouTube isreportedly being exemptfrom the law, even though it is the most popular platform among adolescents there. The government is particularly focused on exempting platforms it deems to have an educational purpose, but TikTok and others have criticized the exemption of YouTube for being an arbitrary sweetheart deal.In the United States, some states have passed laws requiring platforms verify the ages of their users and limit access to certain websites—in Florida, PornHub took its website offline after the state legislature put in place a law forcing it to verify identities. Nobody wants to submit their drivers license to access a porn website.“We’re currently running tests in select regions to age-gate access to certain spaces or user settings,” a spokesperson for Discord said in a statement. “The information shared to power the age verification method is only used for the one-time age verification process and is not stored by Discord or our vendor. For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face. For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.”A judge in Arkansas recentlyinvalidated a lawpassed there that would have required all users of social media to verify their age, saying the law was a violation of First Amendment protections as it placed broad content-based restrictions on access to speech, violating the rights of everyone, not just minors. In March, Utah Governor Spencer Coxsigned into lawa bill that requires Apple and Google to check the ages of users and limit minors’ ability to download apps without parental permission. That law similarly wasstruck downon Wednesday.These laws will likely continue to be challenged in the courts as the First Amendment generally applies to minors.Maintainer|Creator|Source CodeSummoningu/CoverageAnalysisBot"

1hr88jl,AnythingGoesNews,JJJAAABBB123,Because suppressing porn in the Middle East has made their young men so chill.
1hr88jl,AnythingGoesNews,ControlCAD,"Almost two years ago, Louisiana passed a law that started a wave that’s since spread across the entire U.S. south, and has changed the way people there can access adult content. As of today, Florida, Tennessee, and South Carolina join the list of 17 states that can’t access some of the most popular porn sites on the internet, because of regressive laws that claim to protect children but restrict adults’ use of the internet, instead.That law, passed as Act 440, was introduced by “sex addiction” counselor and state representative Laurie Schegel and quickly copied across the country. The exact phrasing varies, but in most states, the details of the law are the same: Any “commercial entity” that publishes “material harmful to minors” online can be held liable—meaning, tens of thousands of dollars in fines and/or private lawsuits—if it doesn’t “perform reasonable age verification methods to verify the age of individuals attempting to access the material.”To remain compliant with the law while protecting users’ privacy, Aylo—the company that owns Pornhub and a network of sites including Brazzers, RedTube, YouPorn, Reality Kings, and several others—is making the choice, state by state, to block users altogether.In Louisiana, sites in the Aylo network direct visitors to use the state’s LA Wallet, a digital driver’s license for Louisianans, before they can enter the site. That system has been in place since January 1, 2023. But the law is not working as the lawmakers would have us believe they intended it. Instead of protecting children from “harmful material,” it’s sending visitors elsewhere across the internet. An Aylo spokesperson told me that the number of visitors in Louisiana “instantly decreased by 80 percent” when the platform introduced age verification in the state. Instead, visitors go to sites with worse moderation practices and no requirements on identity verification for uploaders—just a few of the security and safety practices Pornhub started putting into place in late 2020 amid allegations of abusive imagery on the site and a campaign by religious conservative groups to have the whole platform shut down.Even if someone wanted to visit Pornhub from Florida today, they could easily get around any age verification barriers with a VPN, which we consistently see searches for spike when these laws go into effect.Aylo sent 404 Media a statement about the age verification laws’ progress across the country:""First, to be clear, Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy, and must effectively protect children from accessing content intended for adults. Unfortunately, the way many jurisdictions worldwide, including Florida, have chosen to implement age verification is ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous. Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy. Moreover, as experience has demonstrated, unless properly enforced, users will simply access non-compliant sites or find other methods of evading these laws.""In place of the homepage, in several blocked states, Aylo-network sites show a message read by adult performer and activist Cherie Deville: ""The safety of our users is one of our biggest concerns. We believe that the best and most effective solution for protecting children and adults alike is to identify users by their device and allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that identification,"" DeVille says. ""Until a real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in your state.""2025 will be a year of intensifying legal battles against the creep of age verification laws. As such, there is some hope: Not every state where bills were introduced rolled over and allowed their constituents to face more censorship with less safety. In Arizona, governor Katie Hobbs vetoed the copycat bill there. “Children's online safety is a pressing issue for parents and the state,” Hobbs wrote in a letter announcing her decision. “While we look for a solution, it should be bipartisan and work within the bounds of the First Amendment, which this bill does not.”The Free Speech Coalition filed a challenge to the law in Florida earlier this month, along with several co-plaintiffs, including the sex education platform O.school, sexual wellness retailer Adam & Eve, adult fan platform JustFor.Fans, and Florida attorney Barry Chase. “These laws create a substantial burden on adults who want to access legal sites without fear of surveillance,” Alison Boden, Executive Director of the Free Speech Coalition, said in a press release published in December. “Despite the claims of the proponents, HB3 is not the same as showing an ID at a liquor store. It is invasive and carries significant risk to privacy. This law and others like it have effectively become state censorship, creating a massive chilling effect for those who speak about, or engage with, issues of sex or sexuality.”And in Texas, Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton continues and will be heard this month.Age verification bills like the ones flooding the south and beyond are regressive at best, and actively harmful at worst. They’re not just ineffective, they’re worse: they push people to sites where piracy is rampant and moderation—meaning, protection from actual harmful material—is almost nonexistent."
143j959,applehelp,MightyDeekin,There are basically 3 routes to change the payment method:Settings > Apple ID > Payment and shippingSettings > Apple ID > Media and Purchases > View Account > Manage Payments.These 2 should basically be the same but sometimes one works of the other doesn't. Might be a good idea to sign out and back in from Media and Purchases.Otherwise try online via appleid.apple.com.If none of that works I'd advice contacting Apple support.
143j959,applehelp,Sythro32,Did you fix it?
143j959,applehelp,ArniixGaming,"Yeah, apparently I had unsettled balance cuz of a thing Apple has where it lends you cash for little amounts of online purchases, but you just need to add the necessary money to your card and they’ll take it within 1-2 days"
143j959,applehelp,[deleted],"Holy shit this is mad annoying. I’m trying to download the Messages app to give someone a piece of their mind because I’m so mad rn. But noooo, there’s this absolutely regarded shit I have to do and confused about!"
143j959,applehelp,ArniixGaming,"yo people, just for anyone that hasn't found a fix yet I finally got it (it has actually happened like 5 times since I posted this lol), lemme hook y'all up:first of all, what you want to check if you have a negative balance in your apple account: go to settings, and to your main profile (literally the top of the settings, where your profile picture along with your username display). then go to ""Media & Purchases"" and click on ""view account"".Once there, head to ""Purchase History"" and see if there's any pending payments. Apple usually approves some purchases despite not having money to pay them. I don't know the basis, but my guess is that it's on purchases lower than 5-10 USDs (this is just a hypothesis, take it with a grain of salt).  this has actually happened to me like 3-5 times ever since I made this reddit post actually, but it's always the same fix.If you do have an unsettled balance, or a purchase marked as ""Pending"" or something of sorts, simply add the money to your linked payment method and wait around 48-72 hours for Apple to take the money. Voila! problem solved!Although if that's not the case, and you don't have an unsettled balance or it simply still hasn't been fixed, I'd advice you to go to your nearest Apple Store and ask help from the guys in charge. they are the ones that taught me this fix, after all"
143j959,applehelp,ChoiceDry6685,not sure if i’ll get a response to this but does anyone know if there is a quicker way for apple to take the money!!! it says pending and i’m trying to pay it because the money is there in my account. why do i have to wait ?????
143j959,applehelp,Willing_Host8994,Idk if anyone is still here but just in case I got 10$ from my mom and I decided to spend it on Roblox so I was originally gonna buy the 10$ deal but I accidentally tapped on the 5$ deal which was no big deal I could just buy the 5$ deal twice so I bought it once and bought it again but it said something went wrong for some reason and Apple took my other 5$ for some reason I was mad about it but forgot about it so later I went to go download a game and it kept saying verification required and making me do the same thing over and over mind you I use Apple Pay to buy everything and still to this day I have no money ti give Apple im super frustrated and I really hope someone can help me fix this
143j959,applehelp,Spacefairyjas2000,I'm not working so I am broke so no matter what payment i put its gonna decline because ig immediately charges me 10.66 when I try to verify.

163ito7,AskALiberal,Ut_Prosim,"One thing I will tell you… there is no software mechanism in the world that will stop a healthy, horny teenaged male from looking for pictures of naked women on the internet. End of story.Absolutally correct, but more than that, these efforts to block major websites only makes things less safe for kids.First it pushes kids to shadier foreign websites. Yes major companies like pornhub will block a whole state, but I bet mrhardcore.porno.cx or something won't. Who knows what weird shit is on those pages. If it isn't hard core fetish material, it could also be viruses or crypto miners.Second, it could also encourage kids to use alternative tech. VPNs work well, but most reputable ones cost money. The free ones with no size limit are usually sketchy af. At best they're mining your data. You could use tor, but do you really want a teenager looking at porn on tor? Ugh! You could go back to torrenting porn like we did with BearShare in the early 00s, but how many times are the downloaded videos mislabeled (somethings horrific things) or viruses?This bullshit literally makes thingsless safe for kids, while also violating the privacy of adults. Lose / lose."
163ito7,AskALiberal,Certainly-Not-A-Bot,"I don't think it's possible to stop kids from finding porn if they want to see it. End of story.I further think this law causes significant online privacy problems because verification requires that you send pictures of your face for AI scanning (no issues with that whatsoever) or sensitive ID documents. It's like the dream scenario for identity thieves.I also don't like the law because it's another one of those dumb ""random citizens can sue a person or company over this law if they want to because it would be illegal for the government to do this"" laws that pretty much ignore all logic, the US constitution, and any sort of objectivity just so that they can avoid the government doing stuff. Democrats really need to pass a law like this in California or New York saying ""if anyone owns a gun, any other citizen can sue them for $10000 for endangering their safety"" so that this nonsense gets declared unconstitutional."

Group A complies with the law, requiring ID verification, and B doesn't.  A loses a ton of traffic from people who dont want to hand their ID to a porn company, people who dont consume enough to go through the hassle, and.... people who dont have over 18 IDs.

1hshrm4,AskAnAustralian,Car_Engineer,"There will be a federal election in the next few months, and the legislation could be changed before it comes into force.Sadly, both the Labor party and the coalition support this invasion of privacy, and the chance of the minor parties getting control of parliament is unfortunately zero.Personally, I will likely cut back to the sites that are necessary for my work and quit all of the others.Accounts that are over say 10 years old should be exempt, but that would defeat the real purpose, which is connecting real identities to social media activity, and ultimately making ""optional"" government Digital ID impossible to avoid."

Specifically, the combination of the normalization of extreme sadomasochistic-ish content, or content seeming to depict rape and violent misogyny, along with the tendency for someone to watch alotof porn all at once and jump from video to video.I am skeptical as to whether those laws are a good, effective, Constitutional, or viable method of solving the problem."

1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,thepineapplemen,"In an ideal world, there would be an effective way to verify age without it being tracked and your identity associated with it.I’m not sure if that’s even possible. And I don’t think it would be possible really to prevent determined minors from accessing porn via VPNs or using other sites."
1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,Opposite-Occasion332,"Also at least imo, minors that areinsexual content, are much more of an issue than minors viewing sexual content. But then again, none of it surprises me considering Texas’ other laws and lack of sex ed!"
1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,Pietro-Maximoff,"It won’t really amount to anything - Pornhub is not the only porn site on the Internet, and as long as kids have access to the Internet, they will find porn. A far more ideal solution would be to educate children at an early age about sex and consent, and to actually keep an eye on what kids do online. Give them the tools to navigate the Internet better, as well as an understanding that porn does not equal sex and can be damaging to view it as such."
1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,JadeHarley0,It's just a cynical way to allow the state to surveil people's Internet usage even further.  We have a right to digital privacy especially when it comes to sexual things.  This is absolutely going to be used to target LGBT people and people who are otherwise do not fit into their stupid little patriarchal nuclear family ideal.
1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,[deleted],Agree and somehow it will miraculously not be targeted to those accessing CP
1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,its_a_gibibyte,"I want to give a perspective from a feminist viewpoint, but only indirectly. This is primarily a free speech issue where the law has a massive chilling effect on legal speech. Also, free speech has been critical for the feminist movement, as the movement has always been about speaking truth to power.There's a temptation to make this issue about pornography and sex work, of which feminists do have a variety of opinions about. However, the core issue is not about pornography, it's about free speech."
1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,WillProstitute4Karma,"Exactly.  It is, at it's core, about having people register using government ID through a government monitored system what sort of speech they are consuming."
1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,SocialDoki,More government surveillance is always a bad thing. You can have a debate on whether porn is inherently bad but giving any government entity the keys to the Internet will not improve anyone's life.
1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,TheIntrepid,"Well, it won't stop Texans accessing Pornhub for one. They'll just do it through a VPN, which the article you linked highlights. Those who don't want to use a VPN will be happy to note that there are about 5 bajillion porn sites out there, so access to porn won't be at all restricted. There's also the issue that adults who are above the legal age limit aren't going to want to submit very identifying personal ID to a pornsite. People treat those habits as private for a reason, and for anyone who identifies as a part of the LGBTQ+ community, that goes quadruple.Generously assuming this was done with good intentions, it feels like a very 'old person' solution to a problem that they don't really care to understand. Like a group of old people who still think of computers as scary thought that Pornhub wasthepornsite, the only pornsite on the entire internet, and now they've heroically killed the beast. But that's not how any of this works.Underage people accessing pornographic material is a problem, but this was not the solution, and will probably have greater negative effects."
1bkyvrt,AskFeminists,WillProstitute4Karma,"I'm curious to see what, if anything, they will do to enforce the law against all the other porn content available."
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,BobBelchersBuns,"No, children are not responsible for keeping adults from having sex will them. If an adult isn’t reasonable sure that a potential sex partner is of age then they have a duty not to have sex with them."
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,Sensitive_Mode7529,"using it against the children who’ve been victimized is completely wrong, for reasons you gave and other comments herethe only way i see that this could be ethical is adding it as a charge forthe predatorrather than the victim. if a 22 year old claimed to be younger so that a 17 year old would be less guarded around them, that is wrong. and if OP wants this to be law, they are the people who should be punished for it"
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,Diligent_Mulberry47,"It's not difficult to not have sex with someone. Why do some people make this seem like an impossible feat?Lying about age falls into the perfectly normal category of being a teenager, and it doesn't fall anywhere near the category of rape."
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,GirlisNo1,"The entire reasoning behind statutory rape is that someone under the age of 18cannot give consent.So, what they tell you does not matter. It is up to the adult to ensure everything is consensual AND legal.If in doubt, simply don’t have sex."
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,ItsSUCHaLongStory,"Think of it this way.I allow someone to drive my car. Theylook18. Theyact18. They assure me that they have their license and know how to safely operate a car.They proceed to negligently harm someone while driving. Maybe they hit a pedestrian, or rear-end someone. Maybe they back the car into my neighbor’s fence and destroy it.This person is actually 15. Not only can they not legally drive, but they aren’t legally insurable as a driver (so the “permissive driver” clause of my auto insurance won’t pay for any damages).Whose responsibility is the damage caused?If you say it’s mine, because it’s my car and I allowed this person to drive it, then you’re absolutely right.Part of what you’re missing in this argument as well is that statutory rape isn’t just a crime against the person/minor. It’s a crime against thepeople, usually represented by the state. The state has a vested interest in protecting minors from sexual activity with adults."
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,MerakiMe09,The responsibility is 100% on the adult to make sure or avoid if not certain.
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,wis91,No. If an adult wants to have sex with someone who may not be legally old enough then they should either A) establish to a high degree of certainty that the person is a legal adult or B) not have sex with that person.
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,ArsenalSpider,An adult is responsible. They are the adult in the situation. It’s not that difficult to not have sex with minors. Children will act like children even ones who look old enough. Stop looking for validation for committing a crime.
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,Jazmadoodle,"No. With the exception of two people in their late teens, where one might be just over the age or just under--if you feel the need to ask whether they're legal, they're too young. Look elsewhere."
1ct9b30,AskFeminists,fullmetalfeminist,"How is it that men constantly pretend that ""just don't have sex with them"" is somehow an impossible or unreasonable ask?If you can't tell whether someone is of legal age, don't have sex with them.If you're not sure they're telling the truth about being of age, don't have sex with them.If they lie about their age and you think ""Well, that gives me plausible deniability, so I'm safe, let's do this!"" you haven't been raped, and trying to argue that you have is disgusting.If you're trying to have sex with young women and you decide your boner is more important than being sure they're of age, you don't get to pretend you've been the victim of some imaginary crime."

1dxti1j,askgaybros,BreadfruitNo357,"yeah people are rarely so forthcoming about their actual age, OP probably dodged a major bullet"
1dxti1j,askgaybros,Silent-Ordinary3465,Grindr having a database of government IDs? No thanks.Parents should keep an eye on their children’s internet activity and people shouldn’t be sleeping with anyone who even looks like they could be under 18.

1dxti1j,askgaybros,boredatclass,"The app should be age-restricted by Google and Apple respectively, the stores already have age rating and they already have the user's age on file, just make it impossible to download if the user isn't at least 18"
1dxti1j,askgaybros,Cael_NaMaor,"Agreed!Same thing but more illegal happened to me...He lied about his age, we chat, he sends a pic & his hand looks young... so I asked again & sure enough...As I was cussing him out for sending that shit to people, he blocked me. I reported it to Grindr on both the app & Twitter, got nothing. I freaked a bit (ain't getting strung up for child porn) so I called the FBI who told me I had to contact the Center for Missing & Exploited Children. So I did... brief chat, nothing.Yeah, it went a bit far for a dick pic, but I be damned if some idiot teenager is getting me jailed over their fun time..  to hell with that. Under 18, DON'T SEND PICS!!"
1dxti1j,askgaybros,praguer56,"This happened to a friend's son. He was 19 and thought he was chatting and exchanging pics with a19 yr old girl. He got caught up in a swat action and was arrested. The girl was 16. Nothing happened to her. My friend spent close to $100 large defending his son including some 30-day mandatory program if he wanted to avoid a sex offender label. Again, nothing happened to the girl, at all. Something tells me she was part of the trap and if so, that's just shitty."

1i55qty,AskUK,Bradley_the_Buyer,"Hi everyone, just to come back on this and close the circle for anyone looking for and finding this advice in the future.I consulted o2 arena’s customer services. They confirmed that two children between the ages of 15 (under 16) and 17 (under 18) who are not in the standing area (so seated tickets only) could attend without someone 18 plus.They also made clear that ID will sometimes be checked but it is not consistent and is at the discretion of the security team working that particular event.They confirmed that original official ID is preferred but that they may accept photocopies / photos, again at the security team’s discretion.In the circumstances we decided to chance it and my daughter (14) attended with her friend (16). This was a breach of their terms.No ID checking appeared to be in operation though as I said both my daughter and her friend look much older than they are. They were able to attend the concert without issue."
1i55qty,AskUK,Sad-Huckleberry-1166,"we're going to shepherd's bush, do you think same will apply?  Also are there separate checks  for stalls etc, as we bought tickets for there."
1i55qty,AskUK,Tuarangi,"The policy clearly states that anyone under 15 has to be accompanied by an adult - in case people are somehow unaware of what an adult is, they explicitly state this is someone 18+. I am not sure where you get the idea two 15 year olds or a 15 year old with a 14 year old would be ok - a 15 year old is not an adult. If they looked over 16, they may get away with it, if they are asked for ID, they will be refused entry when they show they are not old enough.Also note than anyone under 16 cannot go in the standing area so if they were bought for that, they would be more likely to be ID checkedTicket terms:6.2  The following restrictions apply to Events taking place at the Venue (subject to any additional age restrictions that may apply to individual Events or Venues):(a) children under 15 must be accompanied by an adult aged 18 or over; and(b) children under 16 may only enter the Event with seated Tickets and cannot enter any standing area. We will not be liable to refund any standing Tickets which have been purchased for children under 16.ETA I am assuming it's a concert without other age restrictions - some events have additional onesETA 2 - down voting me for giving you information that is correct, but that you don't want to hear is not helpful"
1i55qty,AskUK,Bradley_the_Buyer,"Thanks for this. Logically, two 15 year olds can attend by themselves without an adult in the seated area, correct? My daughter’s friend is 15, my daughter is 14, and will be about a month off being 15 at the time of the concert.An ID check would be to confirm they are both at least 15. Not many 15 year olds have official ID beyond a passport. I’m trying to ascertain the likelihood of this being specifically checked and enforced, I.e. if one of them (doesn’t matter which really) does not have ID are they likely to be refused entry?"

1igndh4,AskUK,Accurate_Prompt_8800,"Because (postpaid, not PAYG) phone contracts in the UK typically require a person to be 18+ to sign up. So, if a phone number is linked to a contract, there’s areasonable(not 100%) chance it belongs to an adult. Also some online services canquery mobile networkoperators to check if a number is linked to an adult account.And ultimately, companies implementing age verification are more concerned with showing theytriedto check a user’s age rather than guaranteeing absolute proof.SMS verification offers a minimal-effort, low-friction method that satisfies regulators without being overly intrusive or frustrating adults who don’t want to upload ID. It also reduces drop-off rates in sign ups as people are more likely to complete verification if it’s convenient.In reality, it’s more of a ‘speed bump’ (and deterrent to underage users) than a real age verification method, and anyone determined enough can bypass it easily."

The original NBN was brilliant as it was simply ""Install completely new stuff, and dont use any legacy infrastructure beyond the pathways to lay it in."" And those that had it installed before Labour lost got a much better service. To the point that a street where the houses on one side of the road were done under the original NBN have a significantly higher value than the equivalent houses directly opposite, that have the Libs Byzantine mess of upgraded old phone line systems with each one having to be a BESPOKE installation... which drives the installers mad.And that's why new connections can temporarily wipe out the NBN on the same line. The original system was plug and play, with a lot of future proofing. But it couldn't be allowed to continue as that would give Labour a win. So Murdoch ran his usual disinformation campaign, and enough suckers fell for it. And the cheaper NBN ended up costing massively more, of course, while delivering much less.That Labour never campaigned on ""They screwed up the NBN ... and killed the car industry"" is a failure on their part however. But then later on, after 2019, ""They ignored the bushfire warnings because the reports mentioned climate change... and then tried to blame greenies, claiming they lit the fires.""The Australian Labour Party and the American Democrat Party must have a bilateral agreement to advise each other on the worse ways to hit back against Murdoch's propaganda.

1ckos3n,AustralianPolitics,Street_Buy4238,You mean it's impossible to get between horny teenage boys and that post jizz dopamine hit?!!?!
1ckos3n,AustralianPolitics,unepmloyed_boi,"Many IT professionals will tell you parental tools are sufficient for monitoring your kid and have come a LONG way over the years, being more easy to use and setup...rather than an ID passport system that opens the door to ID theft, phishing and blackmail by tying people's browsing history to their ID and likely to cost taxpayers billions in damages.Makes you wonder if the government actually bothered consulting industry experts and professionals before putting forward these laws or if they have alternate motives."
1ckos3n,AustralianPolitics,CptUnderpants-,"And kids spending hours a day on smartphones and computers are bound to stumble across it, even if they're not looking for it.In my experience (I work IT in a school), stumbling upon a porn site isn't the common way a child first accesses porn. It is most commonly shared by other older children, often unsolicited.The only exception to this is Web advertising. Some innocuous sites may contain ads for porn sites. This hasn't been raised at all by this process and needs to be. It should be an offence to display a pornographic advertisement to a minor, and the advertising networks should be the ones responsible. It would effectively remove porn advertising to anyone in Australia.Responding to eSafety's roadmap last year, the government set a few tests that any age verification scheme would have to meet. They includedconfidence it can't be circumvented, can be easily applied to companies based abroad, and don't risk the privacy of adults looking to legally access porn.Well, there is the issue. Circumvention for all of this is trivial. They can't ban VPNs because business and government uses them extensively. They may not care so much about individuals, but it would be a considerable obstacle for businesses and government departments to fund equally secure and functional tech to replace it."
1ckos3n,AustralianPolitics,[deleted],"I would find this concerning, however, as a 30 year old man I can’t help but reflect on every failed attempt parents and teachers have made to police the internet (or anything else for that matter) in my lifetime. Teenagers, find a way, and just banning things never really works. Focus on something proactive, like education, not a typical boomer-solution like a ‘net-nanny’."
1ckos3n,AustralianPolitics,unepmloyed_boi,"Teenagers, find a wayExactly. Back when I was in highschool, even schoolmates that weren't tech savvy just dug through the internet for tutorials on how to bypass restrictions or jumped through other very intricate loops that made most bank heists look mundane. And now they have Ai to make researching bypasses even easier and give you eli5 explanations."
1ckos3n,AustralianPolitics,CptUnderpants-,"Education is the key. There are plenty of good programs to help educate children about the risks of porn, but particularly about how it doesn't reflect real world relationships or sex. However, many schools won't run them or don't have the money to. Some won't because the parents will believe their innocent little darlings would never access porn and so in their minds it would only achieve educating their child on how to access it."

This was an industry joke for many years until the many IT fails of COVID. More recently the government low-key removed IP Cameras from secure buildings due to the hardware and software being of CCP design and manufacturing.

Yours. Mine. Every search and comment attached to you. All your kinks, all your fascinations, all your honest comments, doxed by the government.Welcome to hell."
1gkbppu,australia,vriska1,That why this is likely to fall apart and be dropped.
1gkbppu,australia,AddlePatedBadger,"Digital natives is a key aspect here, you've hit the nail right on the head. I'm xennial and as a kid had for the time reasonably computer literate parents (they did BBS's and all that kind of stuff when they were a thing). I know enough to know that I will never be able to out-tech my kid. I'm going to have to use teaching and trust to ensure she doesn't get harmed by what is out there."
1gkbppu,australia,QkaHNk4O7b5xW6O5i4zG,"I’m not sure I’d call young people today digital natives like you’d call people born in the 90s that.The tech grads/interns I see get more and more clueless about how stuff works with each year.With that lack of fundamental understanding they’re more in the subcategory of “user-friendly native” where they’re just as likely to run malware or get scammed as dear old granny.But, at the end of the day, it’s the parents jobs to control internet access. And the government’s role should be education more than regulation for this. in my opinion, anyway."
1gkbppu,australia,[deleted],"They tried this in Louisiana, US. All it did was push up VPN usage. Secondly users just went to sites which didn't have age verification."
1gkbppu,australia,[deleted],"Remember when they put “parental advisory warnings” on CDs? That’s so the kids knew which were the best ones to buy and not show their parents.I’d rather have my kids (age appropriately) using social media openly where I can show them how to safely navigate the platforms, learn to recognise disinformation and keep themselves safe from all kinds of predatory behaviour (not just sexual predators).Our kids devices were in the living areas where everything could be seen and heard until they could show themselves to be good digital citizens and even then, we check with them regularly. The benefits of social media have been amazing for my kids - connecting with like minded kids and learning together while playing.We don’t stop children from swimming because pools are dangerous. We teach them how to swim and be safe around bodies of water."
1gkbppu,australia,Wankeritis,This isn’t surprising. Even in the early 2000s we would have bans on certain websites at schools. All that did was make kids work their way around the bans just so they could go on sites they wouldn’t have thought about otherwise.

1gkbppu,australia,TheCleverestIdiot,"It's the oldest rule in the book. If the legal avenue for something people want becomes banned, they won't stop looking for it.

Plus it's a very good update for creeps who are already sus around kids to identify who's a minor (if you think what I said is vulgar then I know your game better than you) I have seen this app become discord over the years for exact reason you are thinking.I am telling this for like the thousandth time just make it a PAID app LKWD or whoever is incharge yall are not slick with free app with in-app purchases thing 😂 well idc now.

17gphl2,AvakinOfficial,ClubSundown,Hi. Exactly the same happened to me. I'm 29. It didn't tell me I looked under 18. It just told me the verification failed. I think the photo capture was too blurry. Same with my passport capture. I contacted avakin support. Here's their answer: for those of us who fail to verify we have to wait 30 days before we can try againI have another question: did you try several attempts? If so did it charge you on each attempt? I tried just 1 attempt with photo capture and a attempt with my passport
17gphl2,AvakinOfficial,Stephenrules15,Okay I'll wait 30 days. I managed to get my money back from Google so I'll wait and try and see if that works. Thank you.
17gphl2,AvakinOfficial,Stephenrules15,Update: I got the Yoti app and it verified me as 18+. Now how would I go about sending that to Avakin?
17gphl2,AvakinOfficial,Aromatic_Flow_9036,If u payed for verification u might need to delete and reinstall the game cause the game been glitching a lot lately
17gphl2,AvakinOfficial,Magicquest213,You must verify through the Avakin Life App.
17gphl2,AvakinOfficial,SeaPalpitation1848,"a similar thing happened to me, I’m 19 and my photo didn’t work but my ID did and now I’m verified. For some reason though i was charged twice for it"
17gphl2,AvakinOfficial,YaniSky,"I stopped playing this game, but I tried the verification to see how that would go, paid it, got my selfie taken, and it said I was verified and it said i received my badge and background. Saw the verification Icon on my profile but the badge was still locked, so I restarted the app. Got back on and the icon was gone and I still don’t have the badge or background, this was when it first came out and till this day still don’t have anything, tried clicking on the verification button in settings again and it displays the same error everyone’s been getting. They can never do anything right.. actually got verified with just the selfie and still don’t have anything from it. That’s LKWD for you😐 oh and they still got my money too.."

1cqxq01,AvakinOfficial,QueenAxo-,I agree. I also think the game should be 100% just an adult game.
1cqxq01,AvakinOfficial,BansheeBlueskylard,"I agree , it should be an adult game , when I joined it was adult game , I think we should have more privileges with age v , I also think we should be able to talk in private on a public server to another age v without being censored , it’s so annoying and it’s not even rude things they censor so much I end up now in the 18+ server all the time because I’m sick of having to be censored for saying even the simplest of words , but yes I totally agree , we are all adults with age v and have the right to say and do adult things ….."
1cqxq01,AvakinOfficial,de58ie,💥💥.  And when you join just like me it was a adults and it was for adults and everybody used to talk to everybody. It didn’t matter where they come from what culture we all talk to each other friendly and it was very very rare. Did you see anyone arguing? Now since it’s been made 12  plus and now see? Nobody talking anymore? Oh arguing yes people bullying people yes it’s all just too much. The kids are ruined the game. 💥💥

1cqxq01,AvakinOfficial,flAvakin,It just needs to be a 100% adult game. Especially at the prices.
1cqxq01,AvakinOfficial,TitleComfortable781,It used be back in the day
1cqxq01,AvakinOfficial,[deleted],"This would be interesting to hear from Maia about!I do believe it has to do with LEGAL ISSUES more than anything (avakin's commercial image matters too, they are working on being more accessible and appealing to ALL audiences and that's smart)!But the LEGAL side is the real thing, that stops it. Regardless of age, there's some issues (especially in MANY countries) for what is legally ok for a commercial application to allow or ""sponsor"" by giving content directly to users.Just as how in IMVU you have to go outside the app (and it's legal rules) for a LOT of the MORE adult content (and can lose your account if you do and lots do), though IMVU allow far more permissive things on the game of course.That said, what you might be missing, is that the rules are to protect avakin legally, NOT to ban or suspend you or your significant other(s). So learn how to type what you want in private with out getting astrix'd or triggering getting flagged and you won't run into issues (I.E. sexually explicit talk gets your account flagged, EVEN if you can type it when 18+ verified, and enough flags gets someone looking at your chats, ALL of them).There's a LOT of players who follow the rules in public verified or not. IF you know what I mean."
1cqxq01,AvakinOfficial,sunpatiens,Yes! 🙌
1cqxq01,AvakinOfficial,deeisnuts,There is no reason why this game should be open to children. They serve only as a nuisance. I can’t even imagine my 13 year old niece playing Avakin.
1dbtzlg,AvakinOfficial,Willing_Tree_2628,"$9?! It was 4.99 like last week?!-update I read the comments, also I wanna buy it now because I’m scared that they might raise it. But can anyone tell me is it worth it?(Ps. I personally do not think age verification should be free because then kids for example could just find a way to cheat it or use their parents thing behind their backs so I feel like despite it being kinda bs it’s almost like an extra layer of security for adult players)"
1dbtzlg,AvakinOfficial,Significant-Win1582,Exactly. Makes no sense for it to be free. It's a way to verify 18+
1dbtzlg,AvakinOfficial,sadlazz,"I honestly dont know why people pay for this...just for getting 18+ content? you guys do know that there is possibility of random kids asking one of their old sibilings to do age verification for them right? biometric age verification can be easily bypassed by using a video and software that allows you mirror mp4 to webcam. Storing data and profiting by third party companies yoti and not avakin company itself is consider as red flag. They should be held accountability and face tough legal consquences when it posted in online. Age verification should never be trusted and should be banned due to how easy can abuse the system in third party. We dont even know how our data collected by the company.. plus the fact that they said we pay age verification for the support, development and use of the third party companies is sketchy af and I can see that they wanna get more profit over privacy. I dont understand this system at all its absolutely worthless and idk who came up with this idea think this is good idea to implent it in the game while its obviously relate to huge privacy concern. This has to be one of the dumbest decision has been made from avakin"
1dbtzlg,AvakinOfficial,avakinveteran,Damn. Is this just the price in your country or did they raise it?

1dbtzlg,AvakinOfficial,Magicquest213,Age verification is optional.

1fjfz5j,AvakinOfficial,Magicquest213,"No, it will never be free since Yoti is charging Lockwood to process the the verifications."
1fjfz5j,AvakinOfficial,Avkn_Sparrow,I believe with yoti (as I used this method in my game before) depends on bundle you chooseThey cost around: 0.30 data extraction Liveness: 0.15 Supporting documentation: 0.20 Document Auth: 0.30 Face match: 0.25But here is the kicker.. Yoti is actually free for business and able to users share age verification without company sharingSo how does it work out $5?
1fjfz5j,AvakinOfficial,yowitheone,And what about the people who already paid five dollars to be verified? Will they get their money back? It wouldn't be fair if something they used to charge for becomes free
1geugb4,AvakinOfficial,Magicquest213,Gotta love rumors! There is no way that people can see how old you are. Even the verification process tells you that they verify that you are over 18 years of age only as it’s not age specific.
1geugb4,AvakinOfficial,Remarkable-Kale5821,No age and not displayed on verified profiles
1geugb4,AvakinOfficial,Advanced_Cattle2810,So it doesn’t show people what age you are right
1geugb4,AvakinOfficial,Melgrrl,That's strange you guys have to pay for it now.  I don't like that very much.
1geugb4,AvakinOfficial,[deleted],It was never free. 😎
1geugb4,AvakinOfficial,[deleted],"I had a good laugh over my coffee.No DOUBT a minor who is NOT age verified started this big steaming pile of misinformation.😭🤣🤣As our moderator Stormy confirmed, the badge ONLY I indicates that you are 18-PLUS.NO ONE CAN SEE I HAVE A FEW GRAY STREAKS in my hair. I can 1000% confirm this as well as that nothing is saved or passed around about your data as they apparently save nothing (it's an ai that assesses IF you are over 18 only and does so in like 2 seconds live).You international wanted-by-interpol players are safe on avakin life (just be careful where you spend those stolen c-notes and the queen's jewels).👻😎☕️"
57c3nb,aves,ricky_tan,I don't think they'll let him in with that because it is expired. I suggest your friend go to the DMV tomorrow and apply for a California ID (or w/e state you're in) and pray he receives before Escape. It usually takes 1.5 to 2.5 weeks.Edit: Formatting
57c3nb,aves,Saltymochi,"He can get in if he brings his passport! If he doesn't have a passport either then the best bet is to go to the DMV and get an ID, they'll provide him with a temporary ID that must be accompanied with another form of ID though (WORKS WITH EXPIRED IDs). So he should be fine with using the temp ID the DMV gives you along with his expired worker's permit ID."
57c3nb,aves,JenDrk,"I would just go for an ID if he can't get his drivers license. It happened to my friend for EDC he went early in the morning to the DMV and got a regular ID and luckily got it within a week. If you went now You should be able to get it in time. I think you can use an old drivers permit also not entirely sure though. Best bet is to email insomniac, they replied pretty quick and were very helpful."
57c3nb,aves,Figueroa54,"Happened to me last year was able to get in with a expired Id and DMV document. I emailed them as soon as I  lost it this was there response ""DMV documents proving the renewal of your lost ID card will only be accepted with a hardcopy of an expired ID/passport.If you do not have an expired ID; please bring the DMV paperwork, a school/work ID with your photo, a credit/debit card with your name on it, and any other documentation proving your age/identity. Although it is not guaranteed, these documents should increase your probability of gaining entry."" Hope it helps"
57c3nb,aves,Time314159,In my opinion there's 0% chance they'll let him in. Insomniac is pretty strict with IDs and with the SBPD being as strict as they are now (see Nocturnal) I'd say his best bet is to go to the DMV.
57c3nb,aves,Snakersolid,Can he apply for a passport on the consulate it does not take long to get one better safe than sorry...

1555by5,BadRPerStories,[deleted],"Great post! I would like to add something, although I never saw this mentioned in relation to roleplaying spaces, there is a widely known scam where people act like you chatted with a minor to try to get you to send them money. If someone claims that you roleplayed erp content with a minor and now they need a large sum of money because the minor hurt themself because of you and you need to pay the hospital bill/they will leak the chats if you don't comply/ or any other story that results in them needing money because you traumatised their child, that is not real. You never chatted with a minor, but with an adult who is trying to scam you. I don't know if this ever happened in a roleplaying context, but I just thought it might be better to warn people because this scam is widely used in other spaces and might extend to roleplay in the future."
1555by5,BadRPerStories,CharmyDracoDreamer,"Thanks for the insight! I hadn't heard of that before. It definitely sounds like the sort of thing that's bound to happen at least once given enough time, I think, so hopefully it helps someone avoid a lot of unneeded stress."

1555by5,BadRPerStories,ShotAddition,"This sounds like the equivalent of the ""Your kid just got involved in a road accident' scam. I've never heard of it in this format but that sounds vile"
1555by5,BadRPerStories,[deleted],"Ask their age and stalk their reddit comment history before responding. Sure post history is great too but people are often very close to how they really are and people are less carefull than with their posts. Do they tell their age in comments and is it inconsistent? Are they commenting in subreddits mostly associated with kids or teens?Do they not introduce themselfs with their age? Do they respond during odd times where most people have to work in their timezone? (it is easier to respond when still going to school).The good thing about erp is that you do not need to start with smut the first scene you write together. Plan at least one scene where you just build up tension or set up the plot, have your ocs talk to each other or anything else. These interactions will often be very telling and shows a lack of understanding in consent, communication and maturity and whether that person is a kid or just a very lost adult is not important at this point anyway, because it is not going anywhere. Better to try to make sure during the planning phase but still include it. Better safe than sorry."

18r7g8v,BadRPerStories,Fiohel,"I've only ever heard of people looking for ID verification in this subreddit, and always in regards to discord. I understand why this might've become a thing but it would be an instant no for me. You do not get to see my private information, thank you.The way I avoid this is by visiting sites that are advertised as being exclusively 18+ where everyone is already supposed to be an adult. No need to ask for age that way, and if you suspect anyone is too young, you can just report them and let the moderators handle it.I would never agree to someone seeking ID verification (let alone a picture of me?) but if you plan to go through with this, do make sure to block out any important information, including your address and the like.Edit: I've been writing for about two decades now, never had someone ask."
18r7g8v,BadRPerStories,ChaserNeverRests,"I've been active online since before AOL existed and a grand total of three online people know my RL first name, no one knows my full name.No way in hell some random RP group would get personal information from me. There are plenty of other groups out there!"
18r7g8v,BadRPerStories,rayezin,"When our server asks for this (in the case of reported or suspected underage - not as a requirement), we ask for the entire ID to be blocked out EXCEPT for the date of birth so that we don’t see any personally identifying information. If some random underage kid has an adult’s ID handy to photograph and jot their discord name within a few minutes, good on them I guess - but despite claiming they’re happy to provide one, no one has ever actually done so. Being called  out is enough to get them to admit they’re underage or just show themselves out. Fortunately this is a very rare occurrence."

I become extra cautious when it comes to my personal info and the internet."
18r7g8v,BadRPerStories,Irohsgranddaughter,"Personally, I'd be at least extremely reluctant to show someone my actual ID.

1df5oc1,BadRPerStories,YouveBeanReported,"For A/B. Legally, the responsibility is age of majority. With few exceptions, that is 18. Hence why most places are 18 ""or age of majority in your area"" While I'd like to know the person I'm playing against isn't 18 but older, the exact age doesn't really matter beyond are you a legal adult.Discorddoesoffer age-gating (at 18) for marked servers or specific channels, requiring you to provide them ID to confirm it if challenged. Personally I think most servers should be using that.I've read mentions of linking to a post-secondary email account, a LinkedIn, a business profile.... Are there any other safe options out there?Isthis safe though? As someone who's grown up with various fandom communities, we had tons of doxxing over the years. Do you really want your place of work provided to a random internet stranger, so they could just walk in to yell at you over ghosting them? Discord only allows one account, and requires a phone number, so what happens when you graduate college and lose that email and can't make a new one?But are you set up for success? Are you given the tools to perform your role successfully?Majority of mods get no tools or training. Perhaps this is different in larger servers, but I've never seen anything beyond informal advice.In my case, privacy law knowledge is purely from working a few jobs where North American privacy laws were a major thing and people regularly got fired over it.""Your data will be destroyed after verification.""Adding onto this, it's onlyVERY RECENTLYDiscord stopped keeping image links live. Copy and paste any random image into Discord, click open in browser and you'll get a URL anyone can access. They were used for image hosting, and never went dead.Open your old chats, and you can search back to like 2017 and find images still.Nothing ever dies online.There's no end to end encryption in sending this ID, or real protection from Discord or the other person.Alsou/WetWhiskers00mentioned questions (sorry for the @) which I'm going to use to mention the issues of Culture.I have memories of a forum once using when are taxes due and put in 'CRA due date is Date' and getting someone messaging me back 'wtf is the CRA' because no one considered international answers.And also limits you to a very specific age band. In my 30s I can't tell you which teachers taught me cursive, and people in their 20s weren't even taught cursive. My almost 60 year old DM did not care about Team Jacob and won't remember Twilight. My 80 year old Grandma had to learn Latin in school. And these are all very similar people growing up in the same areas with vastly different life experience. Location, class, income, and so many things will change these answers.Even with ID, there's an issue. I've have issues with jobs in other provinces because my ID doesn't match exact expectations and that's literally the next province. I've had cops in the US yell at me why my driver licensee and passport is bilingual if I'm not from Quebec.Many IDs have different markers, like barcodes or random numbers which can communicate info and no random server owner is going to know every country and territories ID style and whats important.And, on the snarky side, any adult knows how sucky identity theft is and would be smarter then sharing this so forcing IDs only proves you got idiots or children stealing others IDs.We really can't guarantee peoples age, online or in real life. When I ID'd people at work I was told what to look for, but if the cops came in with a fake ID I wouldn't be fined and arrested for selling someone booze if the ID was the correct year. Even if it was a lie. They tested for did you read the fucking year and did you flag the printer paper ID.The risk to people it too high and frankly, if people are determined to get ID gating contact your representatives working on various bills which will require government issued ID for online interactions which may have inappropriate content."
1df5oc1,BadRPerStories,pasaniusventris,"You said everything I wanted to. The idea of putting anything close to personal identifying information in the hands of strangers who could do anything with it unnerves me- these aren’t healthcare workers who are beholden to HIPAA. There will also inevitably be people who censor information poorly- look how often things get reposted in this very sub with apologies that information wasn’t redacted properly the first go around, and then imagine that with things like drivers licenses and ID cards. Yikes!I come from a time on the internet where it was generally unthinkable to put your real name or face out there, and while I may have relaxed on that here and there, I still hold a ton of caution about giving out anything that could lead to someone stalking me. I see kids on TikTok posting their whole faces, where they go to school, their addresses, and all I can think about is how dangerous that is."
1df5oc1,BadRPerStories,Runepup,"The ""Enter your birthdate"" works for Steam and porn sites. I'm fine with utilizing it for my boards.I mod for one server that will (rarely) ask for ID and I refuse to do it. I would rather just boot the person if something seems sketchy.Asking for ID, even with things blocked out, is way too much effort. Blocking out information on my ID to submit it to some random to verify that I'm not a teenager? Not worth the time or energy it would take to do it when I can go to a dozen other places and get the exact same thing I was there for."
1df5oc1,BadRPerStories,bald4bieber666,i would love a way to reliably verify info without violating personal privacy. im someone who values my privacy a lot while at the same time wanting to be sure im interacting with adults. theres gotta be a better way to do this.
1df5oc1,BadRPerStories,faithiestbrain,"Hi there, OP from the linked post here.I definitely made my original post while I had a lot of feelings happening, and while I stand by making it and by my decision to not share sensitive info I want to clarify a few things that I think are important to this discussion.First off, age verification of any kind is theoretically fine as long as it's clear from the onset of joining that sub/server/whatever that you're going to need to verify in the way that the staff of that place want you to. I will personally not join such a place, because of reasons stated by OP here amongst others, but that doesn't mean it can't be for someone else. I don't need access to everywhere, and I don't make the rules of other spaces.That being said, I don't think there is an acceptable age verification system that can be implemented by your average reddit and discord mods that isn't going to pose an unacceptable (in my opinion at least) risk to users.Let's say common sense for basically anyone would be to black out their name and address because that's fair enough. On some forms of ID your name may be in multiple places, and you may not realize. Your date of birth is also sensitive info, but clearly it can't be blocked out or it defeats the purpose. You also need to have your picture visible, to match with a selfie they ask for, and (in my case) no one even mentioned blocking out my ID number which is definitely another important piece of sensitive info to cover up.So points of failure already include;Mods not telling people all the info they need to block out to protect their privacyPeople making mistakes with what they block, creating a situation where they're effectively doxxing themselvesMods not having secure accounts/internet, leading to breeches that wayAny and everything in the associated selfie that could further betray locationThis is just an unacceptable amount of risk, and that's before you get into the potential for malicious behavior from staff with access to this verification system because let's be honest, some reddit and discord mods are amazing people but there is a set of stereotypes that exist for a reason."
1df5oc1,BadRPerStories,Runepup,People can't censor a reddit post with guides posted on where all the information is. They sure as shit can't censor everything on an ID.The number of people that use the highlighter feature on their phone in black and assume that did it is too high.
1df5oc1,BadRPerStories,MadamMarielle,"Agreed.Malicious behaviour from staff is one of my main concerns.I've known a few (one in particular) disgraceful admins, who have used information against members to cause considerable amounts of harm.These people luckily didn't have access to further data beyond email, handle, and other details willingly given. However, the sheer level of psychotic (literally, I am not exaggerating here) behaviour from them? Jesus Christ. I'd not put anything past them if they'd had more.The problem is we don't know who these mods are. What their mental state is. They might seem fine! But people like that are very good at hiding their shitty side, for the most part. Giving random access to information that could be misused (in the ways you say) is just dangerous and asking for trouble."
1df5oc1,BadRPerStories,FelandShadow,"I have no solutions to this question, unfortunately. People value their privacy, but there isn't a way to reliably prove someone's age on Discord ( yet ). Linking a social media or business account is a no-go, as is posting a photographic identification card. Minors can own Paypal ( or similar ) accounts to exchange money, as long as they have access to a bank account.I would love to hear potential solutions ( that are feasible ) as I plan on making a server for a horror fandom soon, where minors are strictly prohibited due to the explicit content. However, minors pretty much saturate the fandom even though it isn't advertised for them."

I for sure would have done the same for an rp server.  All our important documents were in the same lockbox.  It'd be really easy for me.My rp partners thought I was 19 when I was 16.  We even met irl and they weren't suspicious because it was only a 3 years difference and it only takes minor tweeks in conversations to sound like a college kid.As long as you can write decently, people can't tell the difference.  I know at 40, I literally cannot tell a 16 and 19 year old apart by looking or by their writing.The ugly truth is, if you choose to erp with internet strangers, you are always taking the chance that you will erp with a minor and there's nothing you can do about it.

I use that to get an idea of their age and if I feel that they're immature or they might not be the age they say, I bounce.Also, No offense but instant no, I don't trust your age when I get ""gooning"" ""goonette"" ""edging"". From what I can tell those are Gen Alpha slang words...  While I like to write smut, The moment that your vocalization of pleasuring yourself comes into the pictures, I'm out!--edit--- Account age and number of posts made in a short period of time are also factors that I use."
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,ThatsJustVile,"Edging has been a thing in the BDSM community for a while as far as I know? Respect if you just don't like its use in general, just throwing that out there.I'm also approaching 30 and have found that, unfortunately,  love the word 'gooning' specifically for how awful it sounds LMAO"
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,[deleted],"As I have been approaching the age of 31 and reflecting on my 20s, the idea that someone might have lied about their age just terrifies me tbh (I used to sext anonymously on Reddit, still do it here and there but MUCH less frequently). Doesn’t help my anxiety either at this point because for some reason, my brain has recently decided to hyperfixate on this one specific topic/possibility, even though I really have no evidence or a shred of proof that such a thing has happened. Having said all that, short of asking for ID (since I think people go on these platforms to stay anonymous and don’t want to share that info, it’s invasive to ask, and a minor can just grab someone else’s ID anyways), I just ask my sexting/RP partner their age right away and double check later (asking more than once maybe after the sexting session, or a day or two later in the context of a different convo). I also don’t trust people who say they just turned 18, but tbh the anxiety of this is starting to get too much for me, to the point where I’m thinking it’s not really worth it, since there is no way to actually know if the other person is lying or not."
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,[deleted],"My personal method is the ultimate slowburn: I will RP with anybody but NSFW interactions between our characters will not occur until I've written and interacted with my partner for at least six real months. This has always been time enough for people faking their age to reveal themselves, particularly because very young roleplayers do not have the patience for that and will usually stop writing with me when it's clear I'm not turning our roleplay into ERP any time soon. Worked like a charm so far, and I've managed to write long, in depth and memorable stories with those who actually stuck around for it."
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,ExactHedgehog8498,That's actually smart! And also gets rid of the people in it just for erp!
1e93hvh,BadRPerStories,StrawbieMilkshakes,Mad respect for making this post.That app sounds great until someone mentioned they could use a fake ID.I guess where I am is I don't care enough about ERP to keep trying it when there's any kind of serious issue to negotiate. It's frustrating that it's not just easy but oh well.

16dcchh,beatsaber,SuperSteve35,Idk how to check if I am but I don't think so bc I paid the game and played with random ppl (when I had ps4 online thing)
16dcchh,beatsaber,PixelmonMasterYT,"It might also be that ps4 just isn’t that active, most high scoring players use pcvr/quest. Still doesn’t seem right but that at least could be contributing."

16dcchh,beatsaber,SuperSteve35,I FORGOT TO MENTION: The song is Escape Remix on expert; Also don't have PS4 online although I used to idk
16dcchh,beatsaber,Erigu,"Pretty sure new tracks stopped getting working leaderboards a bit over a year ago, and that was only fixed with the latest patch, around 10 days ago (talking about the PlayStation 4 version specifically, here, obviously).Ithinkthat track was among those affected, meaning any highscore you achieved before the recent patch is considered ""local / offline"" (i.e. it will only show up at the bottom of the screen), and only recent scores go on the leaderboards. That would explain why it's relatively easy to get good ranks on those leaderboards at the moment: they've only been around for 10 days or so. Plus, the best players on the platformmay or may notgive those tracks another try in the future. Maybe some (a lot?) of them have migrated to another platform since then, for instance."
16dcchh,beatsaber,Self_Blumpkin,All platforms have their own leaderboards unfortunately.I get #1 scores when playing on my oculus Rift (OG) and those translate to like ~250 on the quest 2. Partly because I’m MUCH WORSE on the quest 2 and partly because they have at LEAST 10-20x the players
16dcchh,beatsaber,Topar999,I didn’t even know the scoreboard worked because it never shows any scores apart from my own (quest 2)
1bh96ff,beatsaber,Jikhre,"The way scoring works in Beat Saber is that 70 points are awarded for 100° of pre-swing, 30 points are awarded for 60° of post-swing, and 15 comes from how close to the center of the note you hit. For an SS, you need an average of 103.5 points per swing. So, as long as you're making full swings and hitting the majority of the notes, you should be able to get it. By the way, this doesn't mean you should swing hard, just in a decently sized arc."

knlgeu,beatsaber,[deleted],N/A
knlgeu,beatsaber,Copoutname,"It's not so much specifically a skill gap so much as you have to change how you play. You can swing your arms wide for the most part in lower modes, but once you get to expert+ you basically have to swap to what I less-than-affectionately call ""wrist-waggle mode"". It's why I don't ever plan to go to that point. I love dancing and getting good exercise and waggling my wrists just isn't either of those things for me, or fun for that matter.Props to people who can keep up with that mess of arrows even with wrist-waggling, but you don't HAVE to go to that point. There is skill in being able to keep up, don't get me wrong, but the more dramatic difference is the waggle-play change.Also yeah as others said, the whole categorization system is pretty haphazard sometimes and something labelled expert is more like expert++ or something labelled expert is maybe hard at most. It's down the the creator to be cognizant of their own skills and general skills to appropriately label the difficulty.Give me Easy Thriller or Expert Jopping/Mayday/KDA any day."

1c1jh60,BitcoinBeginners,flips712,I resubmitted my verification docs b/c it failed the first time. Now River has locked my account and canceled my reoccurring weekly buys and target buy orders. I thought they were supposed to be self-custody friendly. This started when I submitted my ID and selfie pic for verification so I could move BTC to a cold wallet. Now I can't even log into my account since they locked it. I opened the account around February. This is very frustrating

zhwcx8,BlockchainStartups,omniumoptimus,"Maybe.Maybe you can do a token that is issued upon ID verification by a DAO. Then have the verified person stake a bond. Then, you can whitelist the public key associated with that person. In the event of provable misuse, through a DAO-based review, the bond is forfeited.The key is having other services and agencies accept the ID verification."
zhwcx8,BlockchainStartups,featheredsnake,"Not to be mean but you didn't really have an idea - you are asking for one. The meat is in the implementation, in solving the ""how"". This boils down to asking if blockchain can be used for ID verification. Blockchain in an ID system would help ensure we all agree who ""Joe Moe"" is in terms of his details (including age). It will not, however, be able to corroborate that Joe Moe is actually the person ""logging in"". That is a whole other issue. The solution for the problem you are presenting would not be on the storage side of things (blockchain, or centralized DB). The solution will have to be in the loggin in system. Something like biometrics. Anything you choose however will inevitably entered into an evolutionary competition with other technologies trying to circumvent it (but that is true of everything)"
zhwcx8,BlockchainStartups,magenta_mojo,"Although verifying that it’s actually Joe Moe logging in would be great, I don’t think it’d need to be a hard and fast requirement.

Is it worth normalizing sending government documents to sites you visit (submitting your papers)?imo, parents should just be more aware of what their kids do online.It doesn't effect me, and maybe requiring people to submit ID will make them hesitate which could be a net good"
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,CrabofAsclepius,People already submit their IDs and even biometrics to companies known to sell that information like Amazon and Meta. Not only that but there are apps that track such things as per their ToS like TikTok.This isn't really anything that people aren't already doing.
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,Zetjex,While i think it is important to try and stop kids for finding porn online putting your ID in goes too far. Parents should be responsible for their kids internet behaviour. And schools need to teach internet safety incase they don't do that yet.
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,Chrissyjustshowus,It’s just government just sitting in for no reason
1bg0hw4,BrettCooper,bsheelflip,"It’s a good idea. For a kid to engage with “adult content” 40 years ago they’d have had to steal it from the seedy gas station joint in town or wait until they had an ID and submit it at the desk. The consequence of our digital age is that there is no such barrier anymore. I was an unwitting victim of this, and my friends exposed me to it without me wanting it at an early age. What we stand to lose in sacrificing what we assume is anonymity we stand to gain so much more culturally and societally. Today is different than those days even, and what was once a seedy back-alley joint is now so integrated into our society that the pornstars are our neighbors. Supply and demand is so weird for sex these days and, like it or not, fostering a good relationship between the “supply” and “demand” is actually paramount to a good society. We’re in a stalemate where our sons are telling our daughters “put the OF down” our daughters telling our sons “stop creating the demand”. Why don’t you guys stop fighting and just go make babies already? Alas, I see it going nowhere without intervention."

17twal0,Bricklink,__Booshi__,"You're friend might not run into immediate problems from Bricklink, your friend would almost definitely run into problems on the finance side, most likely with Paypal, as Paypal does have checks to ensure you're old enough to open an account.If you're friend somehow managed to bypass Paypal's checks, then your friend is wading into some real potential legal issues, as minors cannot enter legally binding contracts without a guardian.Ultimately, the issues your friend would encounter, as a minor, would be Paypal and the required tax documentation from doing business. If your friend were to be audited for some reason, their real age would come out in the wash.Edit: There is Paypal for kids, but that too requires a guardian."

1hnj1xx,caf,Direct_Inflation3808,"Yes, I was a contractor, but what should I do now..."
1hnj1xx,caf,Accomplished_Put_621,Have you found any solutions yet?
1hnj1xx,caf,Direct_Inflation3808,"Nope, waiting for the holidays to end."
1hnj1xx,caf,gambit_id_support,"If anyone encounters this issue in the future, you need to put Uber as an employer because it was somewhere you worked, however Uber treats their drivers as independent contractors and they will not complete the questionnaire. CAF is aware of this. As a result, we (Gambit ID) cancel them when someone contacts us asking this question. A recent system upgrade now auto-cancels the verifications for Uber. If any slip through the cracks, though, you just need to go to support.gambitid.com, open a ticket, and we will cancel the verification for you.  This is also the case for other services like this such as Door Dash."
18aw029,CamGirlProblems,kuyariggedalley,"So first, OF does not age verify subs. I tested this by making an account, entered a debit card in a different name that the name I made an account in, and was able to sub to a friend's paid page.Butthis postgoes really in depth on some of the methods"
18aw029,CamGirlProblems,Kinky_Princesssss,Thank you so much for this information. Do you know if models on OF would still be protected if a minor bought content all directly through OF?
1auhfxv,CamGirlProblems,Jade_Next_Door,"A lot of adult sites don't age verify via ID like models/creators do. That's why these new laws are a pain in the ass. There is nothing wrong with age verification, but not at the expense of privacy and untested risk of security issues. Internet usage and monitoring is a parent's job.That said, it's not your responsibility to verify everyone. It's the responsibility of the platform. Most platforms have the ""I agree"" terms and consider a saved or use of a credit card as a method to help ensure the likelihood of a member being 18yo. So if members are spending, it's not as likely that they're underage. This is a risk reduction high-risk business, so it's still possible but lower likelihood. Of course, report if there are concerns of an underage user.You'll come across usernames like that and members asking that question. Young doesn't mean underage. These late teens or early 20s members would see models in their late 20s and older, especially 30+, as older. Therefore, them being young cocks since you're older. Of course, anyone in that age range will look younger than what you're used to, and some people just look younger than they are (just like many of us). I get asked this sometimes, and I just say, ""I like them legal"". Usually, they just volunteer their age afterwards and only asked in the first place to open the doorway for play. All you can do is ask their age and either believe the answer or not, and if not, then report."
1auhfxv,CamGirlProblems,GoddessTeas,"I tell everyone I like 25+ because under that age grosses me out and I don’t want to play with them.Ultimately though by the law, I believe it would be on us not the website should a minor interact with us while streaming. We would be on the hook legally."

1auhfxv,CamGirlProblems,MissFitAmy,"Thanks for this, that’s a good point that at 30+ i’m not used to guys this young anymore and with his clean shaven face his appearance completely threw me off."
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,madamluxe,"I cam on SC and lately I’ve had to put in more hours just to make my average since it’s been slow. But that’s expected with post holiday slowness. Unfortunately since PH is now blocking those states, advertising is taking a hit, which trickles down to sites that advertise there, which ultimately impacts us."
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,ScarletBlond,Thats a good point about the advertising reduction.Do you know if SC is asking for age verification from it's members in these states yet?
1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,ShesSoInky,"FYI 16 out of the 19 already had these requirements in place for most of 2024 - Florida, Tennessee and South Carolina were added as of January 1st.This is the full list of states where pornhub is now no longer available and where ageverification of some type is required to access ""adult"" content:Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Virginia."

1hworpv,CamGirlProblems,morticiamyers,"This is interesting to navigate. Does this mean our social media needs to be cleaned up, or is the social site responsible for that?"
1i6zcqy,CamGirlProblems,dublinrae1,"Personally, I only use social media to bring people to platforms where they can be a verified. It’s not worth the risk."
1i6zcqy,CamGirlProblems,rachelwren,This is the way.
1i6zcqy,CamGirlProblems,Jade_Next_Door,"I'll try to break down the typical methods for age verification (AV) below. ID was the common method, but with age verification laws, websites/apps have made themselves known for business. Since using Webscoop, many seem to pick Webscoop. If not, it's been via ID. I personally haven't had anyone select Yoti app, but I know others have.ID: they send you a pic of their redacted ID, with DOB onlySome SWers require a selfie with IDSome SWers require the selfie in the ID showing as wellSome SWers require ID and paper with username/dateYoti App: everyone must create an account on the app (not website) and it's free.They use ID and selfie to verify, then send a link/code to you that shows DOB onlyOnly need to verify once and can send to multiple SWers who have accounts.Webscoop: is a website for creators to utilize services like the AV portal, wishlists, etc. AV portal was free, but recently changed...but can still be free.AV Portal: 1 credit per person to verify. Pay $1 per credit. A person verifies and you get confirmation if they passed as 18+.Wishlist: 1) when someone buys you a gift, you get a certain amount of free credits, depending how much was spent on the gifts, and 2) you can setup AV to be required when buying from your wishlist.For yourself, you can just create an account on a fan-based site like LF, OF, Fansly, etc because adult sites are legally obligated to ensure we are 18+. You don't need to actually be active and such. Just note in your profile that it's for AV only. A fan account is not age verified, so don't use it as AV for a buyer. Youpay is a wishlist site like Throne or Wishtender, and you can AV and have an 18+ badge on that profile in your bio."

1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,AstraNaughty321,This is probably the most important information that has been posted in this community and I hope people will take this seriously.
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Strictdaddy17,Completely agree and ty OP.  If i had an award I'd give it to you 😅
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Sunnythebunnie,I feel like all sex workers should know no matter what our jobs are always under attack! We should care about these things but a lot don’t. But I’m here to say I care. I have back up plan no matter what.
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,ShesSoInky,"I think some people care but for the wrong reasons - in this instance they care about kids not having access to porn.  Totally a good thing to care about.  But they don't look beyond that.  We're bombarded all the time these days with so much shit its overwhelming so when we hear a simple one we just ""YUP I support that one!"" but looking a bit further in to it tells you maybe you shouldn't.This is how I make my living but I had a vanilla career for over a decade before this.  If I have to go back to it I will.  But I don't want to.  And I certainly don't want to because I have no choice.  And I know a lot of people doing this work DON'T have anything to fall back on....so it's not just fear for myself.  But for others as well.  Which a lot of people are missing.....which is how we got here.  Thinking ""well that doesnt apply to me"" - it will if you don't have a dick.  In one way or another."
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Jade_Next_Door,"Well said 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 It amazes me those who are like, 'there will always be SW and a market for it'. 🤦🏽‍♀️ Clearly, a market existing is not the issue. There's a market for CSAM, drugs, child marriages, trafficking, hacking, etc.Then the comments of, 'things won't be impossible, we'll be fine'. 🤦🏽‍♀️  So weird to be acceptable with a standard of ""not impossible"". That's a whole problematic mentality in such circumstances.The point is that we shouldn't have to jump through circus hoops, have our rights stripped, and then be penalized for doing what we want, profit from, and consent to with our bodies. People are gonna survive doing what they need to do no matter what. But adding all these unnecessary hurdles and punishments so that it limits the people while benefiting those up top is the issue. Capitalism at its finest. We literally could be living in a much better circumstance, but capitalists are more than happy to create long-term/generational destruction of the masses just to say they topped the next best thing."
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,ShesSoInky,Honestly the fact that the market exists and is SO strong is the most terrifying part.  Because they will still want it. They just wont have to pay for it anymore.  And we won't be doing it by choice if they have their way.
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Lizard_Zepplin,"it’s all their big plan to get more wage slaves, people aren’t having kids anymore for a multitude of reasons, and the rich aren’t happy about it. So how do they fix it? Ban abortions so people are forced to have kids, ban being gay or LGBTQ+ so people are breeding more, ban porn so people are wound up and horny and breeding. That’s all this sick plan is leading to, making more wage slaves in the working class so we can be exploited. This country is truly becoming disgusting, i’ve been planning on moving out of country for years now (been saving up) and hopefully i can ik the next year or 2."
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,littlerosexo,"Myself and a few others in the industry have been yelling about P2025 since the end of 2023, and I wholeheartedly believed that if democrats just had the balls to talk about sex workers, it would have been the bridge to the young men and kinda-conservatives who could have swung the election back to sanity.But more insidious than fucking with out lives and livelihoods is the fact that sex workers are being used as the canary in a coal mine for the mass incarceration, erasure, and eventual extermination of other groups that will be classified as ""obscene"". Starting with the trans community.Russell Vought, co-author of P2025 is now the head of the US Office of Management and Budget. Oklahoma senator Dusty Deevers has introduced a bill criminalizing adult content of any kind. IfOK SB593passes at the state level, it becomes that much easier to use as precident to adopt the law nationwide.Everything we warned about is here. The time for prevention is past, and all we can do now is fight. None of us will ever be ""one of the good ones"" to the Christian Nationalists, so being meek won't change a thing for us. All of us need to be loud on our platforms, do everything we can to protect ourselves and our loved ones, resist in every way possible, and never obey in advance."
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,Gwennie_pooh,I really just want to live my life and exist! I'm trans and this whole administration has made me feel like its a matter of time before I'm swept up and put in prison. With the fact he wants to ban porn but also just being gay or queer is so scary! I just wish more people would take this all more serious it will effect lives no ifs and or but about it.
1ikav6n,CamGirlProblems,HairyBiAmelia,Thank you for this helpful summary!! Your labor is appreciated 💜✨
f8tx6d,CamGirlProblems,mirkraa,"This happened to me few times too, I get how frustrating it can be. I took milion of photos and they all got denied for same reasons like yours.My only advice is to just retake photos on the best light possible, not with a front camera and just try again. Make sure your whole face is in, ID can’t cover even a little part of your face. I was thinking everything is perfect but there always was some problem. Then I had my bf taking photos of me in front of the window, great lighting, ID was readable, no fingers covering any part of ID and so. I don’t think they were any better than my photos but after another try, boom, I got verified. I was honestly in shock, I have no idea what’s the reason but you better just try and try. I actually wrote to support too asking what to do but I don’t think my message even got to them as I tried again just after I send it and suddenly it was working."

se430g,CamGirlProblems,blue_delft,Use a lot of day light and NO flash. Keep your phone parallel to the surface with your ID. Be sure that the ID-Card is in focus. Usually there is a minimum distance to observe. Try several distances.  Crop the picture with an editor to the edges of the ID-Card.

13yxs91,Centrelink,trumpstinyhandssayhi,"Bugger, thought that was probably going to be the case, but had a small glimmer of hope that there was another way"
13yxs91,Centrelink,Morning_Song,Yep! This was the reason you saw the long times at Centrelink at the start of the pandemic.
13yxs91,Centrelink,PuzzleheadedYam5996,"Came to say this!Aahhh, the days of hardly ever having to go in are here. Gone are you he weekly or fortnightly visits EVERY time... trudging in and waiting in line. .Remember when your nearest office was a ten min walk, a bus ride, then a train for 3-4 stations, then another 5min walk to the actual office was a thing!?"

1bz23lw,changemyview,reginald-aka-bubbles,"Honest question since i've never used one, but is there any form of age verification for these sites?"
1bz23lw,changemyview,Real-Ruin-5446,Not from my knowledge. I’ve never had to verify while making Grindr.
1bz23lw,changemyview,Ancquar,"Never used Grindr, but on Tinder you have a whole lot of women from 19 to early 20s whose profile text literally says that they are a year or two younger than their age in profile. I always assumed that a significant number of them ended up with this discrepancy because they created the profile before 18, but obviously did not explicitly write their actual age before 18."
1bz23lw,changemyview,madamevanessa98,"Lying about your age is wrong. However, IMO a lot of people are also pursuing 18 year olds who should be aiming older to begin with (personally I think anyone over 22-23 shouldn’t be dating 18y/o) and I think the less time you spend around kids/teens the worse you get at gauging their age. Sometimes you can absolutely tell that someone is young, and in those situations you should be verifying their age yourself to be safe, or date OLDER people who you don’t have to wonder are too young. I think a lot of the time when a girl lies about her age especially, men can tell she looks young but they don’t really care, they’d rather not ask, fuck her anyway, and have plausible deniability. You should never be so horny that you don’t use your judgement."
1bz23lw,changemyview,TateIsKing,"In most jurisdictions it's a strict liability crime, meaning even if the minor shows a fake ID that looks real, the adult has no defense."
1bz23lw,changemyview,SMA2343,"I know in many places that’s a defence for Statutory rape.For example, you’re at a club. You flirt with a girl and you go back and have sex. You have down your due diligence by 1) asking her “how old are you?” And if she says 21 you can think: “well you are in club, and holding an alcoholic drink. I can deduce you are of legal age.”There was many stepping stones for the underage person to pass through to get to you. The bouncer that checks the ID. Maybe even the person giving drinks checks ID as well. And if she had a good story of she’s in university taking classes and knows professors names for some reason.There was a lot for you to believe she is of legal age."
1bz23lw,changemyview,Poly_and_RA,"Do you have a source for that claim? In my jurisdiction (Norway) that isNOT true.Instead the rules about age of consent here go like this:The age of consent is 16 -- it's legal for anyone not in a position of authority or a near relative to have consensual sex with people above that age.There's no punishment for sex with someone under 16 if the involved are similar in age or development; not codified in the law exactly what this means but if you look at verdicts you see that courts have tended to interpret this as less than 3 years of age-gap is okay. (so a 17 year old with a 15 year old partner won't get in trouble, but a 19 year old with a 15 year old partner will)However, if the younger person is older than 14, then sex with them is punishable only if the older person either knew, or SHOULD have known that they are too young. If they have no blame for not knowing this, then there is no punishment. A case I remember is a guy who got accused of sex with an underage girl after he'd had sex with a girl he'd met in a bar. She had faked her ID to get in even though she was only 15. Court said it's *reasonable* to believe that women you meet in an 18+ bar are in fact older than 16, so he wasn't to blame for not knowing that she is underage -- and thus acquitted."
1bz23lw,changemyview,Kotoperek,"You should usually have at least a brief conversation with someone before you start sexting them, especially since they look very young as in close to 18 and you aren't sure whether they really are. If someone is making up an entire persona and lying about their job when they are really in school and so on, that is on them I guess. But usually it is easy to see someone is a minor by the way they text and their choice of topics. If you're also barely 18 or 19, it's fine, nobody would charge you with pedophilia for interacting with a 16-year-old. If you're in your twenties maybe just don't date barely legal teens as a rule of thumb."
1bz23lw,changemyview,DoeCommaJohn,"I’d still say that they are a victim, but their date on the app is not the perpetrator. However, a minor who believes that they should be dating an adult is likely in a bad situation through some combination of parental neglect and outside influences (friends, social media, etc). If we can agree that the child should not be doing that and a typical child would not be doing that, and a child is not fully responsible for their actions, that must mean they are a victim on some level"
1bz23lw,changemyview,Wand3ring3yes,"Nah dude, you're in the wrong. My protocol when it came to online dating was to always ask age, and if they aren't of age to be on the site, report them (multiple times if necessary) and stop messaging. In the long run getting them banned will save them from eventually coming into contact with a creeper."

kqnxeb,changemyview,vulcanfeminist,"I recently graduated with a Master's in Information Science and my thesis project involved looking at how teens are ACTUALLY using social media (bc it's really easy for us to make assumptions but assumptions are pretty useless compared to actual reality). My work was focused specifically on what kinds of mental health related information teens (age 14-19) are sharing via twitter. I went through thousands upon thousands of tweets made during the calendar year of 2019 by 100 teens across the US. It turns out that actually teens are using social media in really cool ways that seem to be having a positive benefit on their mental health. Most of what they're sharing is information about their own personal struggles, they're getting advice from people with similar struggles (including celebrities who are open about their own mental health issues), they're venting and receiving support from peers, and there wasn't a single bit of misinformation throughout the whole thing (which is one of the metrics I was actively looking into). Teens use social media the same way everyone does which is to say that sure sometimes there are negative effects which is true even for adults but there are also positive effects too. Being a teen is hard these days and the simple fact is that people need support and having the opportunity to connect with support all over the world is a pretty big deal for struggling teens. Cutting them off from a significant opportunity for connection and support would be truly terrible and that negative consequence isn't worth it in my opinion.Learning how to use social media in healthy ways is an important skill for everyone and really we shouldn't be taking things away we should be offering them better education and support literally in schools (not just from parents). The simple fact is that abstinence doesnt work and has never worked for anything in the history of abstinence. It doesn't work for sex, it doesn't work for drugs, and it wont work for social media (en masse). The only thing that has ever been proven to work with actual evidence is better education and better support. The fact that adults are lazy and dont want to provide that support or are ignorant themselves and are therefore unable to provide the education isnt actually a reason go cancel things and cancelling everything is a dangerous solution that causes more harm than any good it might do.EDITED TO ADDhere's a linkto my project on the school website, there's a QR code on the poster that links to the paper itself. I want to be clear that this paper is still in the rough draft phase. I graduated at the start of the pandemic and I and my advisors all agreed to table publication (which was the original goal of the project itself) until this coming summer when (hopefully) the pandemic will be over and we'll all have more time and energy to devote to getting this finalized. So hopefully I'll be submitting it for publication this year but it hasn't been published yet and won't be until it's actually finished. I still have all my data and my codebook that I'd consider sharing privately with anyone who's genuinely interested in the research process, just message me."
kqnxeb,changemyview,[deleted],"What should happen if a minor is caught using one? Do they get fined? What if they can't afford to pay it?Even if requiring ID verification might mean that people who don't have the means to get an ID aren't able to use image-centric social media, that doesn't cause them harm any more than the fact that people who can't afford IDs can't buy cigarettes harms them.So just fuck poor people?Why shouldn't it be up to the parents to monitor what their children do on the internet?"
kqnxeb,changemyview,Flite68,"18 is way too high. We need to remember that teenagers aren't children, they're budding adults. We can't treat them like they're 10 years old, completely coddling them - then suddenly push them into the adult world with absolutely no experience with it what-so-ever. We need to give them more and more freedoms as they grow older - and access to social media is an important aspect they should have access to.Allow me to address various points:You claim that exposure to face-tuned images can create body image problems. These issues existed before social-media sites, and stem from various different sources. Although social media sites can expose teens to images with unrealistic beauty standards, you aren't going to help them by prohibiting them from using Facebook, Instagram, etc.. More importantly, you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Even if you did protect teens from unrealistic body standards by prohibiting them from using social media, you'll be prohibiting them from experiencing the benefits these sites have.Instagram, for example, is used by a lot of people to post images that support body positivity, encourages healthier lifestyles such as eating healthy and working out, and also allows people to learn more about photography in general - a generally healthy hobby to have.If the problem is sexualization of 12 year old, why are you prohibiting 13-18 year olds from using these sites?  You're prohibiting the wrong age group.Although predators are a risk, you can't prohibit all teenagers from accessing social media sites because some will become victims. Again, you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. I know it's tempting to say ""we should be willing to do anything to prevent predation"", but that's bollocks. Why not go a step further and make it illegal for teenagers to be out in public without their parents? Why not outlaw social media in general and just nip the whole thing in the bud? Risk is a part of our lives and we need to do our best to prevent predation through education - not by outright prohibitions.Before online sites, teenage girls would read magazines that did all this stuff. The question you have to ask is, is it really that much worse than it was 20 years ago? If it is, is there data to substantiate this? And, lastly, is the problem so vast that it's worth infantilizing teenagers by treating them like small children?One of the weirdest things about becoming an adult is that people forget what it was like to be teenagers. Puberty happens, and teenagers develop this desire to have sex. This happens with and without social media. It's not taught. And consumerism? I fail to see the issue with this. Teens see adverts online and want to buy clothes? By golly, I wonder what it was like before the internet! Ah, yes, teens would spend more time at malls where they would buy clothes. Consumerism has only changed form. Instead of hanging out at malls, shopping is done online.Although social media addiction is a legitimate problem, prohibiting social media isn't going to teach teenagers to develop a healthy relationship with social media. I do believe we need to better educate and encourage healthier relationships with social media, but prohibiting its use will only delay the problem.As true as this is, we need to learn how to educate teens to use the internet responsibly instead of outright prohibiting them from using social media. Furthermore, your suggestion that we ID everyone who joins a site would only further discourage anonymity. Future employment is hurt on sites that force people to use their real names, like Facebook. Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, TikTok, etc., can all be used anonymously. Forcing people to ID themselves on all these sites will simply stifle protected self-expression.13-18 year olds aren't children. They're teenagers. And we need to allow teenagers to transition into the adult world. Access to social media is a part of growing up nowadays. I agree, young children don't need access to social media.Teenagers also sleep in later than adults, but we force them to wake up earlier to match adult's schedules as most work during the day. This is a problem that won't be solved by preventing teens access to social media. Not to mention, there is plenty else to do online outside these sites you listed. Preventing access to social media isn't going to discourage teens from staying up all night online.ID verification would be a logistical nightmare and an invasion of privacy. I don't want Facebook to know where I live, my exact date of birth, my drivers license number, etc.. Some of that information I can provide willingly, but it should be my right to keep this information to myself. Invading privacy to protect children is wrong. We shouldn't martyr ourselves for the protection of children, and should instead rely on education to protect children. After all, providing an ID isn't going to stop predation.See point 10. I'll add onto it though. If teenagers don't have access to sites that require ID, they'll find sites that don't require ID. Facebook may not require ID to create an account, but suspicious accounts are locked until ID is provided proving those accounts are legitimate. So sites like Facebook are actually pretty good with their anti-bullying measures. It still happens, but there are protections. Unfortunately, being ID'd also leaves teens prone to being found by their bullies. Sites that offer anonymity have their own ups and downs. But my point is - teenagers will find ways to communicate with each other online, and to communicate with other people. The risks will remain present.As I stated in one of my points, requiring ID from every single user would be a logistical nightmare. None of those sites would be able to keep up. It would be invasive as hell. And teens would simply find other ways of communicating. And, let's be real, there are plenty of image sites that don't require an account to view images or follow others. A teenager is still going to be exposed to things that create unrealistic beauty standards - and that's a problem that will exist even if you prohibit them from using the internet at all.In high school, I felt we weren't listened to as adults. In too many ways, we were treated like grade schoolers. Going to community college was a jarring, but refreshing, change of pace. One of the issues with adults is that we sometimes become overbearing. You want to tell teenagers they can't use social media - when it used to be normal for teenagers to hop in a car together and travel around town unsupervised. Nowadays, teens tend to hang out with each other at each other's homes. I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but teenagers are going to distance themselves from adults and communicate with others one way or another. It's a part of growing up. Prohibiting their use of social media is going to simply result in teenagers becoming frustrated. And, since ID laws would be impossible to enforce (far too many users vs. staff), it would merely result in teenagers lying when creating accounts moreso than they already do."
kqnxeb,changemyview,Kman17,"Is the implication here that prior to social media, kids had less exposure to unrealistic beauty standards?  That they felt less pressure by their peers to act older / cool?  That they were advertised to and preyed on less?Growing up in the early 90’s, I’m rather confident that it’s not the case.The flip side of kids finding their celebrity icons and tends via social media rather than tv/magazines is that the former iswaymore diverse.Bullying, racism, homophobia is waaaay down.  Kids have more niche tastes and acceptance.It’s not all perfect, but it’s mostly better.Logistically, it’s awful hard to fight technology. Imposing restrictions that are only enforceable on large companies will just push the behavior to less controllable corners of the internet."
kqnxeb,changemyview,Feathring,"Are you saying this should be mandated by law, or that companies should do this of their own volition?"
kqnxeb,changemyview,[deleted],"This assumes that Instagram's only purpose is selfies, and whilst true for some, it's certainly not the case for me and the wide reaching communities I have become a part of. I started using Instagram when I was 13 and used it especially frequently during the lock down in my country this year.You mention meeting your friends on internet forums; I have been able to become part of an incredible community of Lego builders on Instagram by sharing pictures of my own models, and I would call some of these people my friends. In many cases, I have no idea about these people's lives outside of this one specific hobby, including their personal appearance. Still, I think that seeing their builds, as well as their feedback on mine, has made me better at my hobby, and just being able to talk to people has made me a more well-rounded human being.Obviously this is anecdotal at best, and I agree that their should be more support in place for self conscious young people in the age that we now live in; one solution could be to tag photos that use excessive filters, or to discourage others from using those filters. However, I do hope that you can also acknowledge that Instagram, and other social media image sharing sites, have made me and countless other young people very happy, so I don't think it's fair to eradicate it completely."
kqnxeb,changemyview,taurace,"Looking through your comments some of your major concerns seem to be kids being exposed to damaging advertisements and kids being sexualized and exposed to predators. I’d argue those are two different issues with two different solutions.First, I’d argue that many of the “healthy” “thinspiration” lies and BS should be banned for everyone, not just teenagers. It’s no better than when cigarettes were advertised as something to make you sexy. Things that are blatantly misleading and cause severe health issues and deaths should be illegal to advertise full stop.Second, kids being exposed to predators and posting sexualized images is better handled by parents. Rather than collecting children’s information and verifying ages, social media sites should better equip parents to see who their child is messaging and what they’re posting. Sadly, the gap in technological ability between kids and parents makes this very difficult to implement effectively. And it doesn’t do anything for kids with irresponsible parents. But I still trust most parents to do a better job watching out for their kid given the right tools than a giant tech company which is only truly concerned with making max dollars.Lastly, a bit of hope. The internet and social media are still quite new and changing rapidly. Society, laws, and parents are struggling to keep up and rein in the dangers. I see evidence that gen zas a wholeare more cautious online, and have seen the lessons some older millennials learned the hard way. I think things will improve even more when most parents are themselves digital natives and able to keep up with the rapidly changing online environment. More people are becoming aware of the impact of sites like Instagram on mental well-being, and in the future more parents will be aware of the need to limit social media use.Also, the implementation of laws like the right to be forgotten and child privacy laws in the EU are signs that society is slowly adapting and moving in the right direction. It’s a tough battle, especially when only handful of companies wield such massive power and influence, but it can be done.TLDR: these issues are better addressed by empowering parents and legally punishing bad actors than by giving tech companies even more of children’s data."
kqnxeb,changemyview,Wearing_human_skin,"For a few of your points it sounds as if you are punishing teenagers for the faults of something else that could be isolated and dealt with.I'll reply to a few of your points to illustrate my point.2. It's true that Instagram has led to the sexualization of minors and that it leads to more sexual predation. However banning kids outright might not be the solution. Why doesn't the company tighten security for minors? They can offer better reporting services for children to use whenever a creep messages  them. They can implement more effective procedures to identify and punish the adults involved in sending creepy messages to kids. This way there is less harm from sexualization without punishing kids. Kids might still sexualize themselves, but at least there won't be serial rapists who lurk online in search for kids.Now to actually solve the sexualization issue there are far better methods which work than banning teens. For example the body positivity movement took platforms like Instagram by storm in order to educate teens to be comfortable with their bodies. Hard banning things like sex, drugs etc hasn't worked on kids to stop them engaging in such behaviors. Education done the right way has always proven far more effective in changing teenagers' minds.This whole point is also addressed at your 3rd point since 2 and 3 are similar.4. Just like how on Reddit there are moderators who can remove posts for misinformation, this can be implemented for insta scams. This way only products that are child safe are advertised to kids.None of the claims of these ads are verified for accuracy.I agree that disinformation on the internet needs to stop. But it starts at exposing and punishing the adults and companies who manipulate kids and perpetuate the harmful products to them instead of punishing the children who are genuinely just looking for content that will help them improve their body.Skipping back to your first point mainly because I needed to put my strong responses first and this is more of a question.Do you know how big the black market is for cosmetic surgery to teens? Just want to know in order to quantify how big an issue it is for these products to be sold to them. If it is a relatively small problem, it could be solved by countries tightening their law enforcement to identify where these markets occur and shutting them down. Or is it too huge a problem that it's utterly impossible for countries to take the right steps to solve the issue?If anybody has any idea on the stats around this please share if you can."
kqnxeb,changemyview,zippideedoodaa1640,"Why do we need to make rules when it’s really a parenting issue? Teach your kids to be critical thinkers and don’t believe everything they read on the internet. Develop a relationship with your kid so that they feel comfortable coming to you for questions and not creepy strangers on the internet. Teens should be able to enjoy social media, and it is up to them how they use and interpret it. It is up to parents and the education system to adapt their teaching material and style as technology advances... the basic issue is that our education system, in America at least, doesn’t teach you skills or knowledge about real life, we need more classes about sexual, mental, physical health, we need classes on how to use technology and social media ethically, efficiently, and safely, how to do taxes, how to invest, etc. I’ve gotten off topic, but my point can apply to many subjects that I think America is failing to teach the younger generation."

1gb1s8w,CharacterAI,WaterBottle001,"This is a screenshot from the link they shared in the twitter (or X, idc) post.Guardrails for users under the age of 18 implies that there will be a way to differentiate them from users who are over the age of 18. Verification, maybe? Hopefully?Though - having hope rarely ever ends well, so. Who knows. I can dream."
1gb1s8w,CharacterAI,_Rodja_,"If they actually differentiate with that, awesome! Devs have my respect again then for acting like adults should in this kind of situation (if there's not too much marketing towards children, that's sketchy in my eyes and capitalism at its worst). But honestly I'm becoming very pessimistic. With their lack of communication this comes off as them planning on treating everyone as if we were all minors."
1gb1s8w,CharacterAI,_Rodja_,"I sure hope it does, personally I question there being (any) AI stuff for (younger) minors at all to begin with but I understand them too. Not like I wasn't messing with the crappy bots we had in 2010 but those were still so bad they weren't this addicting to a still developing brain... The minors cannot be blamed for wanting to use AI to chat but the developers are adults and should take theadult responsibilityof this. What they're trying to do isn't doing that. Trying to restrict the app/site like this is never going to work fully and children will be exposed to what they shouldn't be exposed to.That ranting aside before this turns into an essay... I wouldn't want to give my ID directly to the app for security and anonymity reasons (obviously it can be figured out anyway but don't wanna make it unnecessarily easy in case of data breaches etc). I'd much rather give it to the app stores that are bigger than individual apps, where it's connected to the info that yes I do use the app but not directly to my chats and data there. They already have my credit card info anyway and confirm my age with that.What devs should do imo:make it so everyone has to update/redownload the app but also make it so you can only download it if you have verified your age to the app store (maybe 16+ but rather 18+ because again it can never be fully safe). Give the users their (apparent) privacy and safety by not directly demanding their ID being connected to their account and data, but do make them verify their age to get access.And if you don't verify your age... Either not being able to use it at all (a bit harsh to the kids who have already been allowed to use it, I know but seriously would be the best...) or make a more... Childproofed version for that."
1gb1s8w,CharacterAI,MariosConsta69,That would literally solve everything.Which is EXACTLY why it will NEVER happen.Funny how the world works ay?
1gb1s8w,CharacterAI,KSword58,Finally something I can agree with.
1gb1s8w,CharacterAI,Lulorick,Even if they add some form of age verification I don’t anticipate that’s going to lead to any meaningful changes with their content guidelines. Like I could totally be wrong and they might soften up on older users but C.AI seems very committed to having a clean and wholesome image. I can imagine the minor side of the app becoming much more stringent with which sort of characters it even allows someone to see and what things can be said during the chat but I don’t think that’s going to come with the added benefit of them loosening up the current restrictions for older users.
1gb1s8w,CharacterAI,SomeUgliRobot,Imagine if the verification system gets added but instantly breaks and things like this get accepted
1gb1s8w,CharacterAI,WaterBottle001,"I mean -- possible, if they make their own. But there's already 3rd party verification apps/services out there, which can be implemented - like other sites do.Which really would be the safest bet, since idk if I'd trust c.ai themselves with photos of my ID."

I've seen a lot of discourse online about how people don't roleplay with other people anymore, that there shouldn't be chat bots like these and it makes me so sad. I used to roleplay with people, but it was always a struggle. Character ai's strength was providing a ton of characters and decent features that made it possible to write stories and be creative! And seek comfort, and find an escape in those stories we right. Whether we create a completely original persona or write as ourselves, it's still so important to have an escape to write with characters we love.I'm hoping that you can find new bots to write and create fiction stories with.

AI platform accounts should be kept anonymous or at least minimally invasive for a reason.Edit: Luckily, we know that the devs most likely won't listen in regards to both the people who want IDs checked and the ones who don't, so it seems we're good here /srs"
1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,Faulty--coding,"I don't like the ID thing at all but there definitely should be some kind of age verification in place. Even something simple where you agree you're over 18. Not only will this cover the ass of c ai from lawsuits but it means they can stop baby proofing the site and making adults suffer. No matter what's in place, kids are going to try and use the site.People need to acknowledge that parents are responsible for their kids and what they do online. It's up to them to check what they're up to and to teach them to use the Internet in a safe way. It's not up to sites to parent children.Making the site 'family friendly' isn't going to work because LLM won't ever be family friendly, things will always slip through the cracks unless it's so restrictive that it becomes unusable. The responsibility of a kid's internet experience is down to the parents."

1gd5b3x,CharacterAI,alexroux,"There are a few possibilities how an age verification could be implemented; for example, through linking your Google account to the site. It should have data on your birthday already and a lot of other sites ask for it, too. I had to verify my age with my ID years ago on my Google profile."

1dqgk8y,ChatGPT,erwood2022,"Stesso identico problema! Ho provato sia con il riconoscimento facciale, sia con il caricamento del documento, ma mi rimanda sempre alla pagina di Yoti in cui devo scegliere il metodo! E ogni volta che entro su ChatGPT, mi chiede di nuovo di verificare l’età! Ovviamente, nel frattempo, proprio oggi, il mio account è stato bloccato!Avevo provato a contattare sia l’assistenza di Yoti che di OpenAI, e per adesso nessuno è stato capace di aiutarmi, mi hanno dato solo risposte inutili. Prima di tutto, Yoti dice che non è un suo problema e che mi devo rivolgere a OpenAI. Ho provato a insistere dicendo però che è comunque un bug che riscontrano molti utenti italiani, e che comunque è il loro sistema (quello di Yoti) ad essere integrato in questa verifica dell’età, quindi dovrebbero cercare di risolvere il problema insieme ad OpenAI. Mi hanno comunque consigliato di ripulire cronologia, cookie e cache, provare da una scheda in incognito, provare da un diverso browser, ma non ho risolto nulla.Ho contattato (di nuovo) l'assistenza OpenAI e, ora che il mio account è stato bloccato (a cose fatte, quindi!) mi chiedono di andare su Stripe (mi hanno mandato un link) e di scansionare un mio documento per la verifica, che sarà fatta entro 3 giorni... Non mi va molto di caricare i miei documenti su una piattaforma esterna, vorrei evitare! Anche perché prima mi danno la possibilità di verificare la mia età tramite un semplice riconoscimento facciale (Yoti), metodo che preferisco perché non voglio caricare i miei documenti, la procedura non funziona, e devo essere costretta a inviare dei documenti? No, grazie!Il problema è che ho provato a creare un nuovo account da un'altra email, come fanno molti, ma è come se mi riconoscesse come stesso utente, nonostante sia una diversa email! Ho provato anche da un account gmail, tramite la navigazione in incognito, ma riconoscono l'indirizzo IP! Come avete fatto voi, a creare altri account?? Grazie!"

1fqdom4,ChumbaCasino,No_Willingness8651,"Just out of curiosity, where did you find this information?  I'm not disputing what you've posted, just genuinely interested."
1fqdom4,ChumbaCasino,vaginalvitiligo,I literally just copied and pasted it from this article. Reason being is I had been working on putting something together myself because I hadn't seen it all in one place. But this is the closest that it can go as of right now cuz there are still other filings that still haven't completed. This is what I've seen to be the most comprehensive coverage of all publicly available information.https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=49c941ea-6e07-44a7-ba2a-91f699d5b938
1fqdom4,ChumbaCasino,Electrical_Skin_4857,Following
1fqdom4,ChumbaCasino,Final-Asparagus8805,So what your saying is that I can sue all of the social casinos and win as long as I have an account with them.
1fqdom4,ChumbaCasino,vaginalvitiligo,"You would need to apply through an attorney and meet eligibility requirements. I can't determine if you're eligible. But realistically, yes if you have an account you most likely You would have a case. It all depends on what state you live in and what your situation is.I'm not an attorney so I'm not telling you anything definitively that you can or cannot do nor am I giving legal advice."
1fqdom4,ChumbaCasino,WonderfulTennis3476,"Pretty sure it depends on the operator. Things chumba has and continues to do are the reason they are getting sued and will most likely lose. For example, frivolously denying mail in entry forms, lying and manipulating gameplay etc.Not to mention the woman that initially filed the claim SMARTLY excluded herself from their arbitration clause which is really going to help this case big time."
1fqdom4,ChumbaCasino,PotentialGenius99,"I just won over $200,000 on PulszBingo and during my redemption they locked me out of my account and sent me an email saying they will not be fulfilling my redemption because I am in violation of their Terms of Service.  Which, I am NOT... I've read through it front and back and sideways and I am not in violation of anything.  My account was already verified, I've been playing for months and months with absolutely no issue, so now that I had a big win I'm all of a sudden in violation.  What do I need to do? I'm sick, literally sick!! My father is an attorney... so cost isn't an issue... please tell me what to do..  This is so wrong and so unfair."
1fqdom4,ChumbaCasino,vaginalvitiligo,Maybe reach out to the kind law firm as they're handling a few cases there or really any consumer protection attorney might be able to help.

1jwykd9,ClaudeAI,ThenExtension9196,Bro you just made up all this crap. They probably just asked because local law requires it or they want to mine your data. Age verification is super important for advertising.

1jwykd9,ClaudeAI,Spire_Citron,"I'm glad to see more LLMs backing off on this. I remember trying to use ChatGPT to edit my writing a year or two ago and it would freak out at EVERYTHING. Kissing, the slightest violence, the barest reference to anything sexual in nature. It significantly impacted its usefulness for that sort of thing. It would even edit out any swearing without being asked to."
11hzrfd,CloudResearchConnect,jherara,"What I find more interesting is how this goes directly against what I was told after I read in the privacy details that CR would be sharing things like names, addresses, etc. with their partners. The response I received from support on 11/9/22 is below:""2. When creating the account we only receive your email. We do not collect personal information like your name, address, etc. When you take a survey posted by a researcher they will make it clear if this personal information is required from you to take the survey. This personal information would then be collected on behalf of the researcher as we do not receive their survey data in any way. You can decide not to take a survey if it asks you to provide them with something like your name, address, zip code, etc.""So, it would seem that they've changed the terms of service. It would have been nice to have received an email alerting everyone of that change. But, of course, that now begs the questions: Who will be allowed access to the details shared when verifying identity? Personally, I don't agree with pain-point incentivization. Either they need everyone to verify or they don't. If they don't, then why are they prioritizing those who do above those who don't feel comfortable with yet another online company or site having personal details to share with just about anyone, per the terms of service?"
11hzrfd,CloudResearchConnect,[deleted],"They're not directly receiving the details of your ID. They're partnering with Stripe. Stripe does the ID verification, and just tells Cloud Research whether it was successful or not. Stripe doesn't transmit any of the data from the ID verification to Cloud Research."
11hzrfd,CloudResearchConnect,WyldBlu,"Totally agree with you here. I am FINE with getting paid via Paypal. I am NOT comfortable at all, with sending my ID verification to a company for priority notifications. Does this mean that if we DON'T verify ID, we will start missing out on HITS?

11hzrfd,CloudResearchConnect,remoteworker9,"I don’t mind getting verified, I did that with Testable Minds (joined Prolific early enough that I didn’t have to). I just won’t ever be opting for Amazon gift cards. I’m completely happy with PayPal."
1egr4m4,CloudResearchConnect,spiffyshxt,"Search the sub to see other instances of this, but there have been a few people who came in here to post with screenshots included due to receiving the same notification on their dashboards.Just for context, it's not the same optional ID verification that they claim allows more prioritization for projects (a lie), it's something that you must do within a certain window of time or your account is put on hold or waitlisted. Previously, it was mentioned in the sub so infrequently that it seemed to be something they did on a case by case basis, but due to all the waitlisting/banning for alleged TOS violations, I wouldn't be surprised if required ID verification in order to participate became mandatory."
1egr4m4,CloudResearchConnect,KiznaTowryk,"I received it as well, logged in to check and it's right there on my dashboard. It's genuinely frustrating having to be forced to do so. I have a 850 score, I've been approved for well over 1k surveys and I've been using connect since 2022. Why now all of a sudden?"
1egr4m4,CloudResearchConnect,curbstxmped,"Yeah, I got it today as well. It's a legit communication from Connect. You can also go to your dashboard and see where they mention the deadline there as well.I won't be responding to it since I don't use Connect much anymore and it makes up such a tiny portion of my overall income. In terms of my performance, I have a perfect score and have never received a rejection. I'm inclined to believe they are just rolling this new requirement out in waves, and they'll likely force everyone to verify eventually. It just kind of comes with the territory, though. Integrity has to be protected with online research and all. I'll come back and update with what happens when you don't respond to the request after my deadline is up.edit: Waitlisted as of 8/7, which was my ID verification deadline. Hope this helps someone."
1egr4m4,CloudResearchConnect,SnooSquirrels798,what do you use instead of connect? prolific?
1egr4m4,CloudResearchConnect,jherara,"I don't usually respond on this sub, but I noticed a few people automatically linking refusal with fraud. It's important to keep in mind that many companies are now using driver's licenses and other photo IDs to train AI systems to create avatars without paying the people in their systems a single cent for the use of their faces. They're also using those IDs, with a person's photo and home details, to sell their products and services, which means more chances of hacking. Lastly, some people were vetted through MTurk, thoroughly, and then invited to come to CR based on years of previous work. So, I imagine it would then irritate or worry them to have to prove who they are when their identity was already proven several times and the identification service could put them at greater risk of identity theft. It's for these reasons that some government agencies and nonprofits are now accepting mail with letterhead or a postal mail address card as proof of address so that people aren't put at greater risk.Note: I'm speaking in generalities based solely on the OP's statements and personal experience with and statements read online about MTurk and not on anything I've seen on the CR site, since I don't share publicly or privately anything I've seen or experienced on the platform."
1egr4m4,CloudResearchConnect,literallydondraper,"I’m pretty sure it’s done through a third party if I’m not mistaken? Not to say that couldn’t have issues, but Cloud doesn’t perform the check directly. I did it as soon as I signed up, have had no problems. I remember it being somewhat optional but encouraged to get more studies. Not sure if researchers can filter participants that way or they just say that as an incentive. It raises your score which is probably irrelevant to you at this point"
1egr4m4,CloudResearchConnect,Ok_Lifeguard_5373,"I got it too, I've been on there for years and never had an issue. I went to check out exactly what they're asking for and when I click to verify my identity it doesn't open and it freezes the entire page, on Chrome and Firefox. My ID is expired and it would take a couple of weeks to get a new one, so unless they let you update it later, I guess I'm finished. I don't do too many on there anyway, but it's a little frustrating, I have zero rejections and now I'll lose the account because my id is expired."
1egr4m4,CloudResearchConnect,literallydondraper,"The safest would probably be to not take studies until your ID comes in. That being said, I’ve seen other people on this sub who’ve said they’ve been fine without it, but that might have been before the great purge. I’m not sure lol"
1egr4m4,CloudResearchConnect,oceanmoney,"I have not received any messages in my CRC inbox or emails about this kind of thing whatsoever. I mean, time will tell, but AFAIK, nothing about this so far.EDIT: There is also not a single announcement on my dashboard, it just looks default. I believe if they're going to start forcing verification for each participant, then that's how it is going to be. Prolific has already ruled this method as a hard requirement. So I guess if you're uncomfortable the whole concept, then that's going to be a huge roadblock."
1eo3lbc,CloudResearchConnect,GungGravy,"Don't trust Connect with my ID. They've not discussed who has access to it, how it's stored, or how long it's stored. All very valid concerns that should be addressed before rolling this out. I'm sure we'll get the usual silence from Connect, so why bother?"
1eo3lbc,CloudResearchConnect,Dear-Ad-3614,"I got it too. I'm not happy about it. Just yesterday I saw two different articles about ID confirmation businesses having major data breaches, and another company I work with is also asking for something similar. The more of these companies that have my ID the more likely it will get out there somehow."

1eo3lbc,CloudResearchConnect,etharper,I just got this in the last couple of days and it pretty much means I'm done with Connect. My ID expired a couple years ago and since I don't have a car I don't really need one so I haven't gotten a new one. So it looks like after several years and no rejections I'll be done with Connect. I'm not making much money on the site anyway.

1eo3lbc,CloudResearchConnect,AngeloD888,I wonder what happens if we don't do this. Is this mandatory?

1i240yd,Conservative,v7z7v7,"The problem that I have with this is where does it stop? What’s stopping a state from requiring an ID to look at a gun website, social media, etc.? There are plenty of things that require a physical age verification, but that information isn’t stored anywhere. This information would need to be stored or require verification every time you go online. I could easily see something like a state saying you can’t access a political campaign website without age verification because you need to be 18 to vote, so access to the website should be restricted to adults.Also, I definitely don’t want to hear anyone supporting this, but opting out of the facial recognition scans at the airport or freaking out over having an Alexa or Rumba in the house."

1gavvj1,Constructedadventures,Briaaanz,"It's a good idea to come up with a story for the escape room. The story helps guide you into what puzzles to use. So, where are the kids in this fictitious scene, what's the story?What ages are 4th & 5th graders?  A lot of escape room props use recommended age ranges not grades.What kind of props do you have access to?For puzzles: Avoid long cryptograms or puzzles that require a lot of reading. With repeated groups, you'll likely want some time set aside between groups to let you reset the puzzles. Still, you'll want to choose puzzles that can be easily checked and reset between groups."
1gavvj1,Constructedadventures,ember3pines,not OP but 4th and 5th graders are typically 10-12 yrs old depending on their bday in the US.
1gavvj1,Constructedadventures,RoxyRockSee,"You could tie it into The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and have the Headless Horseman looking for his head, which is in a locked box. Then pull things from the story to create the puzzles for the lockbox code. Maybe have a picture of a bridge with a certain amount of supports to give you one of the code numbers.Or a witch stole the Halloween treats and they have to find her cauldron, which is in a locked cabinet.There are plenty of ideas on Pinterest or Teachers Pay Teachers.You'll need locks. Ones you can choose the code for are better, but you can also use a bunch of locks and keys.I've seen people use LEGO bricks as an alphabet or code, like one brick is an O, a brick with a square on it is N, and a vertical brick on top of a horizontal one is E, so the answer is ONE."
1gavvj1,Constructedadventures,inkzillathevampsquid,"Spend an hour learning about escape rooms and how they work. And while I normally wouldn’t say “google it” you really can find TONS of teacher resources for escape rooms and even purchase them for cheap to download premade for you to just set up. The key is making the environment set up in a space where its clear what is part of the game and what is just the classroom stuff. So see if an empty room can be set up for clarity.And as a “game master” you also need to plan guidance and clues if they get stuck. Its not easy to learn how and then create one so quickly. Especially when you need a break between students to re-set all the puzzles. It can get exhausting so make sure someone is able to help with keep time and resetting up for the next group.My advice (just in this situation) is to buy one online that is meant for students that age and made by teachers. Then you can always change it up or have a template to work from.Also, this might get me downvoted but don’t overlook Chat GPT."
1gavvj1,Constructedadventures,gottaplantemall,ChatGPT can be super handy for this stuff. Helps overcome some brain farts and creative blocks. Even its generation of bad or mediocre ideas gives me something to either realize I don’t want or to build from into something I like.
1gavvj1,Constructedadventures,MyPatronusisaPopple,"Get yourself a uv light, uv pen/ink, some locks, and containers. Get a cryptex or number locks. You can use zip ties as make shift chains if your containers don’t have a place for locks or if you have plastic containers you can eye hook screws to hook locks through.Start at the end result first. For example, maybe the kids have to find the antidote to a poison from a mad scientist or one of the teachers have been infected to turn into a zombie. The antidote is in the box with a number lock. You might have the number put on a puzzle and it’s written with uv ink. They have to find the puzzle pieces put it together and get the uv light. Which you may put in the cryptex and have the kids unscramble letters that they find to solve.You just have to make sure that you have enough set dressing so they can spend time also searching. Since it’s Halloween, you may consider hiding keys or clues in play doh or slime.I’ve made a few escape room for kids and teens at my library. Mine average between 10-15 minutes. Make sure to give yourself at least 5 minutes between sessions to reset. Use some hacks to help you for example if I use locks with color, I’ll put a blue key in a blue container or blu play doh. I tell the kids when we are done that everything should stay on the tables. Some kids want to help put stuff back but may mess up where it goes or potentially could jam a lock."

1gavvj1,Constructedadventures,fin_the_destroyer,"I made a fun wizarding escape room for my library a couple of years ago (absolutely not Harry Potter themed at all, honest) the story was you were stuck in a classroom and you had to escape before the grouchy caretaker of your wizard school finds you. Two mischievous twins had hidden a bunch of clues that would spell out a phrase that you could give to a living portrait (me in a cardboard picture frame on a stand) and open a secret passage to get out without being caught.A couple of the puzzles the kids enjoyed: I made a wand with a magnet on the end and one of the puzzles was casting a spell to move phoenix ashes and reveal a clue, the phoenix ashes were iron filings and the magnet on the end of the wand shifted them out the way. The ashes were in a photo frame with the clue printed off and placed under them. Later on in the room was a white board with potion mixes written on it, they had to make each of the potions (they were pretty fun to make with food colouring and different ingredients, the favourite was a foaming volcano one) the final potion you had to put your wand in to stir and there was a metal key inside that stuck to the magnet when you pulled the wand out. This opened a padlock on a cool looking wooden box I borrowed from a coworker.There were various other puzzles that involved solving clues and it took 10-15 minutes to solves. Because of the potions it did take a little bit longer to set up in between groups."

1hz6oj6,Constructedadventures,ChrispyK,"I've been getting my ideas together on this, and I have a few tips and puzzle ideas for you!Build the hunt Linear.  No branching paths, nothing to divide their attention.Minimize word puzzles, (literacy pending, you know your kid)Use things they're more familiar with (colors, people, foods, etc)If you have a puzzle with multiple parts, color code each part.  Do everything you can to avoid ambiguity.And here are some puzzles:Jigsaws are good, but consider taking an extra step and drawing a picture on the back of it to a recognizable place/object.Put this thing back where it came from (tidying up)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-b7ZAfiuNsIf they know their ABCs, try a ""What letter comes next?"" puzzle, where they do a +1 Caesar cipher.  Warning, your message can't include the letter A.Emphasize cool moments, not everything has to be a puzzle! (Blacklight, freeze key in block of ice, hide a clue in a balloon, etc)Shapes can be used to clue a number lock, just tell them to count the sides.Opposite puzzle (Stop Above Day Dark -> Go Under Night Light)Dot to dot picture of a recognizable object/locationhttps://www2.tinkergarten.com/activitieshas a lot of activity suggestions, it can be a great jumping off point to browse through this site to see what you think your kid would enjoy."
1hz6oj6,Constructedadventures,witchybitchy10,"Sorry forgot to respond to this last night, thank you so much for all these ideas including the YouTube link (looks like loads of videos on that account as well will have to sit and sort through them to see if there's anything else from there and the tinkergarten site).Confident reader (she only struggles with bigger words like 'obscenities') but her spelling is a bit all over the place if she is given a non-phonetic sound but will be able to recognise and read it correctly (i.e. she couldn't spell 'language' correctly because of the hidden 'w' but if she saw it written down in a sentence she would know what how to read it). Crosswords or anagrams with phonetically spelled words is probably an option but finding phonetically spelled words is annoyingly difficult in the English language (think it's like 20% of all words).I like the idea of balloon one as she loves balloons and I could make it look like a sweet or lollipop but she doesn't like loud noises so would be reluctant to pop it, block of ice would be interesting if I can tie it in to the story and giving her warm water squirters to melt it. Definitely stealing the count the sides on the shape idea, that would be perfect for the storage key lock box one with a 4 digit pin.The jigsaw one we did in partners that she liked revealed a treasure map to the final treasure. Makes sense to do it in linear stages as suggested (write a story to follow a flowchart) rather than a bunch of different branches and will avoid adding any red herrings that could confuse her."
1hz6oj6,Constructedadventures,chaoscontrived,"I love that you're doing this! Regarding your playdough clue (love that, btw), one time I suspended a bunch of random keys in jello in a huge Ball jar. I did it in phases where I let a layer of jello get solid, placed a key, added more jello, another key, etc. I used gelatin with food coloring. They had to reach in to get all the keys out and then figure out which was the right key for their lock.I'm sure you could add something to make it opaque. I had mine in the fridge though right up to the discovery, and it was really cold for my partner to shift through. Next time I'd leave it out of the fridge once it's solidified.Another thing that might be fun is a blacklight and highlighters/blacklight markers. You can even put ""secret"" clues on their regular clues, let them find the blacklight later in the game,then let them discover the secrets on the clues they've had the whole time!I think I have some other tricks I've used that would be appropriate for a kiddo, I'll think on it."
1hz6oj6,Constructedadventures,witchybitchy10,"Love that, added jelly to my list (I've got a large glass jar in the back of the cupboard that would be perfect for this) and blacklight markers to my list! Blacklight markers has actually triggered a vague memory when I was younger of secret codes revealed by a liquid (lemon juice perhaps or something?) as part of some kind of spy game, if I do Charlie and chocolate factory themed I could even label it liquid sunshine like the book."
1hz6oj6,Constructedadventures,MyPatronusisaPopple,Popcorn would be a fun alternative for a sensory search. Easier to clean up than rice. You could get tall sensory bottles and fill with popcorn. One has a clue the others don’t or pieces of clues that need to be put together. Especially if you do Willy Wonka themed. You could also have the storyline of finding a hidden recipe that Wonka hid in his factory. There are some easy ways to add a false bottom to a box. Attach a ribbon to help indicate to pull up to reveal the fake bottom. I’ve made some with dollar tree craft boxes.
1hz6oj6,Constructedadventures,witchybitchy10,"Have a 2 year old in house so can't have popcorn I'm afraid but could maybe do jelly beans or another kind of sweetie? First thought was cheese balls as an alternative as family loves them and can get a big tub at Costco but not really Charlie and Chocolate factory themed as more savoury.Definitely leaning towards Charlie and the Chocolate factory themed. We're going on caravan holiday in June and have found a place nearby that is a chocolate factory where they can make their own chocolate - thinking the end prize could be a golden ticket to the chocolate factory as her main birthday gift.Love the idea of a secret hidden recipe, will look up ways to add false bottoms to boxes, I think I have a spare shoe box in loft I could add a false bottom to."

1hz6oj6,Constructedadventures,emertonom,"I'm working on a similar kind of a thing, but I haven't got a lot of good puzzles yet. I've been brainstorming, though, so maybe one of these ideas might be useful to you.One idea is just things that can be physically combined. These don't necessarily need to have much of a puzzle aspect to them, because there's still a delight in the surprise of seeing the answer revealed.  So, a piece of paper with holes cut in it can go on top of a page of text and block out everything except a few letters or words, revealing a hidden message. Or a strip of paper can be wrapped diagonally around a cylinder of a specific diameter, making the letters line up into a message.I also thought about incorporating a box with a few assorted small objects in it, so that she would have to reach in and identify the objects by feel, and pull out a specific one. My parents made a game along these lines for me when I was young, and I have fond (if vague) memories of it. (There was also a commercial version available back then called Feeley Meeley, but I'm pretty sure ours was home made, or at least home augmented, and may have had more variety as a result.) The objects were things like a matchbox car, a spinning top, a spool, a thimble, a smalll fuzzy toy, a Fisher Price Little People figure, an eraser, a feather, etc. Small, safe to handle extensively and without seeing them, with a variety of textures and shapes. I don't know exactly how to turn it into a puzzle, but I think can offer novelty, which can be pretty valuable.Another unrelated design that sounded possibly interesting used images drawn on a sheet of transparency, but hidden by laying the transparency over a black background. The kid could then insert a triangle of white paper between the black and the transparency to represent the cone of a flashlight beam, and use it to shine the light around a drawn scene and spot the objects hidden on the transparency. Again, not sure how to use it, but think it sounds like it could appeal. Might be better suited to a puzzle in the form of a book, though.Another idea involved a maze drawn from walls on a grid. She'd find a path to solve the maze, and then have to relate that to a separate grid with letters or numbers or something on it. Maybe every third step in the path would highlight a letter, and this would spell a word.I do worry that I'm going a little too far into simplifying the puzzles--she's a very smart kid. But I'm hoping the excitement of the process will offset that.Sorry, this is pretty rambling. Hope there's something useful in it."
11y27ci,CreatorsAdvice,SansaAdvice,"There is always a chance of data breach, no two ways about it.IDs have been leaked before on sextpanther but that was due to hugely negligent data handling and basically 0 security measures. This is big time speculation on my part but I think sites like onlyfans and patreon using a third party to verify ID could potentially be a good thing because it seems less likely that information like images of your ID are being stored in the same place as account information and these company's entire business is handling sensitive data, its their only job so hopefully they are good at it. They have a page about their securityhttps://www.jumio.com/about/technology-security/.

1jeaymy,DataAnnotationTech,Independent_Bid_2521,"You can use your id from your originial country. I did id verification last year it's similar to my case. I got dash of doom the very next day after verifying but got the dash back after 2-3 weeks. Was really scary ngl. If you don't wanna take a chance, get some physical id first and then verify it lol."
1jeaymy,DataAnnotationTech,VanessaSeaWitch,Do you have any official ID with a photo on it? I think they just want to make sure your picture matches your face to verify you are who you say you are. I used a driver's license from a state I no longer live in and it went through for me. I don't know if that helps.
1jeaymy,DataAnnotationTech,maelstromm7,Did you use a license from a different country or just a different state in the US?

1d79b5n,datingoverforty,BurnTheOrange,I don't have social media. I don't mind if someone wants to video chat or meet first in a public place or group activity. No way in hell am I sending pictures of my ID to someone I don't know. That would feel like the start of a scam to me if someone asked me for a picture of my ID online.
1d79b5n,datingoverforty,Vegetable_Bet_9218,"Thanks, I never ask."
1d79b5n,datingoverforty,explorer1960,"I don't generally share of any of that in messaging.I prefer to meet in person in a public place, and then share.So far no one has asked to video chat."
1d79b5n,datingoverforty,[deleted],I ask for a video chat and then if that goes fine I meet them in a public place.If they've shared their driver's license (I would NEVER do that!) what more can they give you.
1d79b5n,datingoverforty,[deleted],N/A
1d79b5n,datingoverforty,[deleted],"If your instincts are telling you something is amiss, I'd just take it as a sign that you're not compatible. You can't reasonably investigate them and turn over every detail of their life before meeting for your own comfort. If things escalate to a phone call and/or video call and it still seems like something's missing, I'd just decline to meet them and end the connection.I'm someone with very little presence online, and I'm sure it makes some people uneasy. They're completely welcome not want to get to know me further because of it. My feelings aren't hurt over this.Also, I once dated someone who was very forthcoming about who he is (met his friends, got involved in his hobby, compared notes in our careers, showed me his drivers license, gave me his social media handles, always responsive on texts and phonecalls), and while I had no doubt about his identity, nefarious things about his character later surfaced that he couldn't hide. I just mention this as a warning that you can get all the details upfront, and they can still be hiding some pretty major dealbreakers. There is no 100% guarantee about someone.I'd just start with a phone call and see how you feel from there. I know sometimes people ask for a full name so they can do a background check, but I'd never consent to that myself and don't expect other people to hand me that information at the start either."
1d79b5n,datingoverforty,[deleted],By meeting them somewhere safe. Even then it doesn't mean you ever really know someone. People can be effectively deceptive for years. Once you are actually in a relationship it is just a leap of faith.
1d79b5n,datingoverforty,[deleted],"Video calls and in person meets. I'm assuming by verification of identity, you mean they're not a catfish or scammer."
1d79b5n,datingoverforty,Standard-Wonder-523,"I've never asked to supply my driver's license.  I have however given my full name to any match that we've scheduled a date for.  From this, one can search me, and find stuff with my pictures, which easily look like the guy in my profile photos.  But they also weren't the same photos, so it's pretty easy to imagine I'm a real person.Consider that your ""comfort"" that someone is who they say that they are might be just that; comfort.Someone choosing to impersonate me has a number of public photos that they could choose.  Moreover, what one could publicly learn of me would give some incorrect conclusions; many of my photos/presence online had my wedding ring.  To help combat that, I did make my relationship status public on FB.  But beyond that, my account is pretty well locked down.There will always be an element of risk in trying to get to know someone.  Consider instead of trying to wrap yourself in comfort, you instead look to set down boundaries and standards that will make you bolt.  I.e. you show up somewhere and the person is not at all as pictured.  Immediately seek assistance from the employees of making a quick and private escape.  If you start hearing inconsistent stories*, just leave and block; don't ask for a ridiculous story/excuse.*Someone says that they've never been married, and later a marriage does pop up; but it's OK, she's in the past.  Wink wink.  Wink."
1d79b5n,datingoverforty,thaway071743,I don’t? Sometimes we will talk about where they work and I might Google a little. But I don’t expect even a last name before meeting them. I don’t usually give mine.

1aw7f3f,dating,Alexis2337,"Sorry you experienced something like that! I dont know how really common that that happens usually, but I haven't heard much of situations like that really occur as often. (I prefer to meet in real life), but online apps can sometimes make people test the limits sometimes if they're being truthful or not. Because I would assume whoever is starting to look for a relationship would be comfortable in their own skin and be true to themselves etc. He looked young for his age, which you mentioned and he just took advantage of that and lied.It's messed up on his part because if he's really insecure about that then I wonder what more lies he'll do down the line you know? It also is messed up cause it can then cause trust issues for anyone down the road and it looks like it's gotten to you unfortunately, which is totally valid. I wouldnt beat yourself up for it and what you went through, it's not your fault at all and it doesnt make you any less for not knowing, anyone possibly could have been fooled also.In the future with whoever your seeing, if you still feel a bit worried of a persons age or having doubts, it wouldnt be weird at all to mention this story you explained to the person and make sure they are being honest with the age they tell you etc. Surely they'll understand provided the context you mention.

tterjg,dating_advice,Tinderella80,"Your age isn’t about you. It’s about the person looking to date someone who is in an age bracket that they are comfortable with. Many posts on dating groups I’m in are about men who lie about their ages so would recommend against that. Planning on lying to any potential dates is really poor form.If you’re that hung up on your age and your own history that you can’t bear to discuss either honestly then you need therapy, not a girlfriend."
tterjg,dating_advice,Reasonable_Hunt443,"Tinderella, the problem for some of us--which it sounds like you don't see--is that when someone is over 45 or 50, the differences between physical age and chronological age can be profound. I am a genetically lucky guy who has lived pretty clean and folks regularly guess me at 15 years younger than I am. But now that I'm in my 60s, prospective partners are just running away from the number. Imagine if you had to post on the first screen how wide your ass is... or how much you weigh. That's what we're talking about here. I want to let the pictures do the talking, otherwise I'm stuck with agism that I can't avoid. I can still do over 500 pushups a day--but the number doesn't even let me get to the table to meet someone in similar youth and shape to me."
tterjg,dating_advice,[deleted],"The age limit is to prevent underage children from joining, and to allow adults to date within a certain age bracket. It's not meant to criticize anyone."
tterjg,dating_advice,InfernoFlameBlast,A dating app that doesn’t disclose age is a TERRIBLE dating app
tterjg,dating_advice,jazzfairy,Um so based on another post you’re in your 30s and want to look 18-23……… 🚩
tterjg,dating_advice,Avocadofarmer32,Is there a reason you want to hide your age? You’re only in your 30s according to your profile. How young are the girls you are trying to date.
tterjg,dating_advice,[deleted],You sound like a creepy old dude Here.People want to date someone within their acceptable age range. You can’t be all ‘I feel 20’ when you’re 50. Be an adult. You are how old you are.
tterjg,dating_advice,Individual_Baby_2418,"When I was a young person using dating apps, I wanted to find people like me - similar age and background. Where we might have similar interests and goals. I also wanted to have kids and wanted someone whose sperm was relatively young.I think trying to hide it makes things worse. It makes people wonder why you’re holding things back and if there’s something deceitful or creepy about your motives. Best to just put it out there and let a potential match decide for themselves if they have an issue with your age. (And I promise people aren’t asking themselves why you aren’t married with kids yet)."
tterjg,dating_advice,Ang3lsCurse,"The replies go off on a tangent and morals that aren't even related to the question.Dating apps have filters. There is no reason for the app to disclose your actual age.Tinder is the only one that I am aware of that let's hide your age but you need to pay a subscription.If you're out of someone's age range you'll never match with them.Better yet, they should not show you people not interested in you, but they'd rather show you as many attractive people and you not matching is the cherry on top because they get money whilst you use their app and never actually move off of it.Some people have nefarious intent, maybe lying about their age, photos, etc. The last thing you want is for all of those strangers to have personal details about you.Having been discriminated for my age, for being younger and older, I went from replying my age without a thought to not telling people. Only, some people get offended if you don't want to disclose that information, which is kind of ironic, because those same people will get offended if you ask them something they aren't comfortable with.If the OP had nefarious intent he could just lie about his age, but his question indicates he does not intend on doing this.A picture speaks a thousand words: if lying about your age is bad, what are decade old bikini photos on holiday with makeup? Don't tell me not disclosing your age is remotely akin to all of those filters and make up photos you see online.I don't see how disclosing age protects anyone? Minor: hi, I'm 20 40 year old: hi I'm 20 Logic: None existent.Reality Honest people not disclosing their and and not caring: I had fun or I'm not interested... well I'm 30. Omg I am so now interested. Yeah... no.Woman that are attractive and look a decade younger? You're not going to care that they're actually a decade older, unless they don't actually look their photos and actually look older than their age, or are even lying about their age."
1avc1x7,delhi,chefkc,"The legal age in delhi is 21 to drink state wise age differs, I think adults can carry alcohol across the border, also I think you’re allowed .

1i56cvk,deliveroos,Bowman359,"All apps NEED a ""customer looks over 25"" button. its embarrassing asking people old enough to be my parents for ID"
1i56cvk,deliveroos,StorageResident6219,It’s clearly a flawed system. Why do I have to ask a 50-year-old person for their ID?
1i56cvk,deliveroos,EnvironmentSmooth542,"I have quit doing age restricted deliveries about 2 years ago and everyone else should do too. We don't get paid extra for them and we risk getting terminated over some bullshit like wife ordering some wine but instead the husband opens the door and gives his ID and then we get a warning or worse, termination because the DoB does not match the one in the app. I'm aware that you have to enter a certain amount of DoB wrong before you get a warning but still, the policies and rules around it are ignorant and brainless to say the least.If enough riders boycotted age restricted deliveries then maybe Deliveroo would relax them. It should be challenge 21 or challenge 25 and fully up to our discretion when we ID someone or make a simple flowchart with questions in the app for example ""Does the customer look over 25?"" If you press yes then you can continue and ask for the code, if you press no then you have to ask for ID and enter their DoB so the app can check if they are over 18. Simple as, I've never heard of a store that has a policy that requires all employees to check IDs if someone is buying something 18+ no matter how old they look. I would like to see Will Shu ask a man who's clearly retired for his ID."
1i56cvk,deliveroos,PrincipleSuitable383,"Sainsbury’s cashier told me to not forgot to ID if they looked under 25, told her Deliveroo has an ID everyone policy. She was gobsmacked “even a 60 year old lady, I’d be fuming if someone ID’d my mum”."
1i56cvk,deliveroos,ManTrynaLive,The way I treat it. Ask for ID. Any resistance or issue take DOB. Mystery Shoppers ALWAYS have id in their pocket. I simply ask “are you a mystery shopper” by using the words “Any id?” and never had an issue. Once I asked “any ID” out of habit to a 90 year old woman and the lovely woman got her passport out for me 😂
1i56cvk,deliveroos,PrincipleSuitable383,"This is a good strategy but I think you’re missing OP’s point. Apparently, if you enter too many DOB wrong you’ll get flagged. So the OP is saying, even if you ask you can’t guarantee if the dob matches with the one they signed up with and what if someone else opens the door. Personally I only ask if they look under 25, others I don’t ask at all, never had any issues."
1i56cvk,deliveroos,Glittering-Put-609,What If they put the wrong details in when they first signed up too?
1i56cvk,deliveroos,selfy121,Exactly it's not good on us
1i56cvk,deliveroos,Time_Engineer_5196,Simple. Reject all age restricted (if you can afford to). Not touched one in years and never happier.
1i56cvk,deliveroos,Commercial_Travel_35,"I will no longer do alcohol orders for this reason. Young people are fine with ID, and usually have plenty of ID on hand.Older people especially boomers seem to think being asked for ID is against their human rights. Plus the long waits, at the door waiting for them to find a passport or a driving licence.Deliveroo etc should bombard their alcohol buying customers, stressing the need for ID as much as they bombard their riders.My next door neighbour has an alcohol order from the Coop almost every day from Deliveroo. Not one has asked him for ID!Before a customer can buy alcohol they should have to upload their ID to the app, to filter out those who have no ID at all, and there are plenty of those in my town.I've had people come out with letters from the DWP, bank cards etc... fine but not ID and I'm made to feel terrible.Also if its mixed in with general shopping you would have go into their shopping to remove the age restricted items. It really ought to be packaged seperately."

This can happen if Delta flags your account for security—like logging in from a new device or a random audit.Here’s what to do:Complete the Identity Verification Form: Follow the app's prompt under ""SkyMiles Help."" Have your ID and SkyMiles number ready.Contact Delta Support: Call their SkyMiles team if you're short on time. They can verify your account manually.Check-in Alternatives: You can check in at the airport kiosk or use Delta’s website as a guest (with your confirmation number).Hopefully, this gets sorted quickly, and you can focus on your trip.Safe Travels!!"

1i3kmbx,Destiny,Public-Variation-940,"Nothing wrong with it in principle, it’s just practically ridiculous."
1i3kmbx,Destiny,TheMarbleTrouble,"It’s a way to avoid fixing the issue, while painting those that have solutions as wanting kids to watch porn.The issue is that parents do not have time to be with their kids. Watching porn or watching Tate, is the direct outcome of parents not being able to be with their kids. We need things like the child tax credit proposed by Harris, but beyond first few years. The priority should be helping parents be able to inhibit bad behavior of their kids, regardless of it being porn or tide pod eating tick tock challenges.This ban will not impact a single porn site that broadcasts from outside US. The only sites that will be impacted by this are the legitimate sites like PornHub, that don’t really have some of the nastiest shit online. Two girls and a cup is one of the nastiest porn that is commonly known, which hit mainstream without just being on a porn site. To execute the ID restriction effectively, they would need national filtering that currently exists in China and Russia. Not just for porn sites, but all sites being able to display images or video… which is all of them.This will not solve the problem, but becomes an excuse to avoid addressing the problem and might result in significant limitation to what is viewable on US Internet."
1i3kmbx,Destiny,[deleted],"It's inevitable but there are much better ways to do it. Pornhub is trying to push for device based authentication where your Apple/Google/Microsoft account has a proven ID verified age set. The porn service (or any other 18+ site) then makes an anonymous call to them and due to restrictions placed on those accounts, can only retrieve validation of your age. Apple/Google/Microsoft would have no idea what the service is, just that you authorized something to verify your age. I think this is much better than submitting your photo ID or image of your face to an unknown third party."
1i3kmbx,Destiny,[deleted],"It's fucking regarded to make Americans give their identifying information to access porn. This shit could be breached and that's how you end up with data hackers threatening to send your porn searches to your family unless you pay 500 dollars. Or even worse, politicians pressured to vote for specific laws under threat of revealing their porn browsing habits. Nothing good comes of this."

zwvet5,dfsports,[deleted],"ever wanted to cash outI did that exact oregon drive for a while and then had a big 5 figure win and then they immediately flagged my account lolAre you certain that your account was ""flagged"" because of residency or was it simply the typical verification process that goes with any win of that magnitude?From a legal standpoint your residency shouldn't matter, only that you placed your entry from a legal jurisdiction. It's little different than cashing out a futures bet you made while on vacation in Vegas - sports gambling may be quite illegal in your state, but you weren't in that state when you placed the bet.I've been doing the sort MA to NH drive to use the DK sportsbook for a number of years now (its even tacitly encouraged by my DK rep as a loophole to play) and have never had a problem - whether that be with cashing out or with tax implications. If you're physically located in a state where DFS or wagering is legal then your residency really shouldn't matter."

zwvet5,dfsports,knowtoriusMAC,Your loopholes will work fine until you try to withdraw or win a large sum and need to go through their verification process. Then they'll lock your account and take the winnings
zwvet5,dfsports,godsocks,"I drive to Oregon all the time to play. Sucks not to be able to play DK anymore but I get by with FD. Never had any issue with any payouts. It’s no different than if you place a bet in Vegas and win. As long as you were there when you placed it, it’s legal."
zwvet5,dfsports,ActivityUnable,Get a friend in a legal state to open up the website for you on their desktop. There after teamview into there and play your dfs on sundays. I did this a few year backs when I was out of the state. You just got to find a friend to use their computer or a spare computer on the side.
12cms68,discordapp,AtomArneDK,"FLAWED? FUBAR is the correct word for it.They recently asked me to update my age for my discord account, i, by mistake typed in the wrong year.After 4 tickts, countless mails with documentation, my account is STILL! scheduled for deletion due to ""under age usage"". I have a server with +200 people on, and i am UNABLE to manage it while the WORST! support team in history does, somthing!"
12cms68,discordapp,ImmediateNorth6695,"Perhaps this is so.  However, look from the side of the discord.  So they do everything right, if a person under 13 years old receives a notification / warning that his account can be blocked, he will immediately take the necessary measures and will be able to fraudulently dodge it.  And so the user is immediately blocked and does not give him time to forge documents or another item.And usually, to find out that a 12-year-old user is not extremely difficult.  They give themselves away with their less educated behavior and manner of speaking."
12cms68,discordapp,MasterChickChick,"It's far too easy to exploit the system. All Discord need is some random guys word and an entire account is termed. Seems a little extreme. To me, it makes far more sense to warn the user via email before escalating to fully terming the account with no evidence."
12cms68,discordapp,Fun-Farmer7188,"So, you are ok with some random dude at a large company handling your sensitive personal identifying information without valid reason? Most people think that's pretty stupid especially considering you aren't supposed to put that shit online to begin with due to the risk of data breach, bad actors etc."
12cms68,discordapp,BigPappa__,As It should be
12cms68,discordapp,[deleted],This is the second time this happens to me…
13mnthg,discordapp,[deleted],"You're not alone, and doing some ""investigating"" when checking the network the verification responds with a 400 (Bad Request) and response is ""You need to update your app to verify your phone number"".Considering I'm using the website, there is something else that's wrong on Discords end, and I don't think it's a shadow ban."
13mnthg,discordapp,Junky_man_himself,Thanks. And why do you think they were asking me to verify with phone whenever I switched accounts? This didn't happen for me at least until May.
13mnthg,discordapp,Elliot_Rodger_2203,"I have this exact same problem, it's been 6 hours already and it still says the ultra rare error message, if you manage to get in let me know"
13mnthg,discordapp,sanikdah2019new,"I have this same problem.  I'm trying to log in to my account, but it won't let me due to the stupid phone verification that doesn't work!  ARGH LET ME IN!!!!!!!"
13mnthg,discordapp,Quirky-Study-5901,Press  escape
13mnthg,discordapp,Quirky-Study-5901,QUICK FIX : NOT AS YOU MAY THINK. Just press esc or escape and WahlalaCredit:Quick Fix Post
13mnthg,discordapp,Junky_man_himself,"Hey thanks. So pressing Esc let me beyond the phone verification part but now Discord wants me to ""claim"" my account by another log in verification but nothing happens after I log in. Is this another error?"
13mnthg,discordapp,No_Abbreviations2700,"(For pc users), Login to your phone and verify on there. Eventually it'll log you back onto your account on phone and pc."
13mnthg,discordapp,cuteybearboi,"Had the same problem, current fix that worked for me and should work for others is to login on the same account using the mobile app and then verify your phone number from there. You can then log back into the desktop app and remove your phone number (because discord 2FA is awful and no one should be using it)."

15h2ck2,discordapp,[deleted],"By and large, any bot with the ability to join servers for you shouldn't really be trusted. Browse the support forums and you'll find a huge population of users that had their accounts disabled for violating ToS and it goes back to this issue. It's probably the second most common cause for account bans aside from age verification."
15h2ck2,discordapp,Splatoonkindaguy,They honestly should just remove this permission unless they get explicit approval for each server or something
15h2ck2,discordapp,RedditUserPotato,ty for telling me that
15h2ck2,discordapp,[deleted],N/A
15h2ck2,discordapp,Hotair10,What kind of servers are you joining if you expect the server itself to get banned?....
15h2ck2,discordapp,A-Dilophosaurus,ExactlyRestorecord isn't inherently bad but it's rarely used for good
15h2ck2,discordapp,ryry013,"I have never heard of this bot and I don't know anything about it so I'll defer to others on that, but one note on the point about your IP getting revealed, just from a bot standpoint or Discord server standpoint, there is no way to get the IP of a user.However, by going to their website, which you mentioned you did, that gives them your IP. Otherwise, everything from Discord is routed through Discord; no personal data is sent."
15h2ck2,discordapp,Skripp0,"When you went to the restorecord site and performed the verification, they were in the backend able to link your IP to your discord username. This would need to be done outside the discord api."
15h2ck2,discordapp,i_need_good_name,RestoreCord gives the server owner your IP when you verify.
15h2ck2,discordapp,RedditUserPotato,"Yo, are you sure about that?"
17yzduf,discordapp,Markiemoomoo,"If Discord thinks that you're underaged, yes."
17yzduf,discordapp,Optimistic-Dreamer,I’ve had to do this to join nsfw servers to prove I’m over 18. This is normal. Most I’ve seen ask you to write your discord tag and the name of the server on a sheet of paper and place a redacted pic of your license on that sheet.
17yzduf,discordapp,Hype365,"Based on this comment here on another post 20 days ago, either you got your account back once and then got it disabled again for an age report again, or you still haven't done as they stated EXACTLY. If you don't do EXACTLY as stated (including the selfie) then your account will simply be deleted for being underage age as they are legally required to comply with child online protection laws which prevent them from storing information about underage users."
17yzduf,discordapp,gergobergo69,"The birthday numbers on my ID was blurry, so they asked me to send again after a few daysafter I sent another one they instantly let me through 👍"
17yzduf,discordapp,ChiisanaSoraNi,If you're appealing an underage ban - yes.
17yzduf,discordapp,I_AM_DA_BOSS,Only if it’s an underage ban appeal
17yzduf,discordapp,Agreeable_You_8841,They want your blood type too
17yzduf,discordapp,raz0r_ttv,DNA code while you are at it
17yzduf,discordapp,TropicaL_Lizard3,"Yes, if you got banned for being underage. I doubt you are one, but at a very high likelihood someone reported you making a joke about your age. It happened to some of my friends under a false reporting campaignP.S. Out of most rules, Discord takes their age policy very seriously and will respond swiftly to such reports. It's part of the law. Just a heads up."
17yzduf,discordapp,mx20100,"If you’ve been reported for being underage, how else would they confirm it?"
183u9pu,discordapp,piano1029,"No, there is nothing someone has that officially confirms their age except a form of ID or their birth certificate."
183u9pu,discordapp,RadiantLimes,"There are websites/companies which will verify someones age for you using their identity , so people would have to be willing to upload their government proof of age. which can be linked back to a bot which tells the mods so they can make the person with a role. Most channels in the server are locked behind this role. Though this is not a free service as you would need to pay a monthly fee or per person fee."
183u9pu,discordapp,Virtual-Possession83,Have any idea on what those websites are?
183u9pu,discordapp,[deleted],"You can ask for an image of them holding a legal ID with the DoB visible. If its just to verify age then just about everything else can blurred aside from the DoB without any issues.If you need to verify who theyclaimthey are (probably more than the case of NSFW servers or such, where people try to take their identity), then having their face visible is probably okay but you need to have a trustworthy staff team for that. But if it's just a gaming/community server then it doesn't need to be that in depthThere isn't a way to do it without ID unfortunately, but the top option is probably the safest/least intruding one as all that's revealed is their DoB"
183u9pu,discordapp,Virtual-Possession83,"Thank you, Auto! It would also be more sufficient if we had then write and lift up their server username also just in case also for the first option. Once again, thanks!"
183u9pu,discordapp,alexytomi,you could politely ask for their birth certificateit has to be a request rather than a demand or it's illegal i think
199fq28,discordapp,Acceptable_Dot,"this happens all the time. discord is tmk legally required to ban suspected underage accounts quickly, but the fact you had ID verified means that their internal systems are probably worse than I, or anyone else, previously suspected.I have yet to hear of someone who was able to recover s account banned for being underage, but I do hope you recover your losses."
199fq28,discordapp,[deleted],N/A
199fq28,discordapp,Antique_Big8316,"I was able to recover my account after being falsely banned for being underage, I even have tons of back and forth emails proving the same.Showed my license and birth certificate and examination result sheets and whatnot to them, they didn't accept it but in the end, I re-sent one of the images I had previously sent and added ""I give up"" and they unbanned me lmao (I was 1 day away from account deletion, discord takes 2 to 3 days to reply to emails)"
199fq28,discordapp,[deleted],"My account was recovered shortly after uploading my ID for proof, but they never sent me an email back saying it was unbanned 🤷🏽‍♀️ I just tried to log in and it worked. So could've been unbanned for ages just sitting there because they never told me"
199fq28,discordapp,tnix100,"I've seen people get banned multiple times for being underage, even though they've provided their ID to Discord before. It seems like they don't add a note, a flag, or anything to a user saying they've submitted ID in the past and to not ban them for being underage in the future."
199fq28,discordapp,[deleted],"Did you ever even so much as joke about being underage or send any message that would make anyone think so, sarcastic or not? If so, that's why."
199fq28,discordapp,Low_cops,nothing i can remember. ive seen some NTTS videos on the topic and it looks like you can report anything out of context and they will just ban you automatically.
199fq28,discordapp,Martinez_Majkut,"Said im underage in joke terms, sent a ticket and waiting 10 days atm for the respond. 20 days left before they delete my account, Discord support is horse shit."
199fq28,discordapp,SoPLyA_Dx,"Dude, they also blocked me for allegedly being under 13. I sent them my photo with my ID, but I haven’t received a response for 14 days. Apparently, discord technical support is in no hurry to answer"
199fq28,discordapp,KhyanLeikas,"Support safety team is dead. You’ll get barely an answer then they will forget about your tickets, and your account will be permanently deleted in 14 days starting from the first day it’s been disabled (banned).They use an AI system to flag automatically account for :Underage users based on comment history;CP content sharing detection (which is 60% reliable, so 40% of banned users are innocent).What you can do is :create a new account so disrespecting discord rules, but who care since you’ve been banned wrongfully anyway.uninstall discord and not recommend the app anymoreuse discord free and never spend a dime anymore on itkeep sending ticket and be disappointed by being ignored.This is the worst support safety team I ever seen in a platform so you better never talk about age or nsfw stuff to keep your account safe.I don’t really understand what is going on but my guess is that they don’t bother with banned accounts anymore and want to fill a metric so they can be seen as a platform taking action against illegal activity, but it’s starting to be seen more and more so discord will be in trouble one day.I know there’s at least someone still working in the safety team but I don’t know what they are doing, looks like they just redirect people to send ticket which are only managed by an automatic answer bot. So discord maybe has no one working there other than unreliable AI and shitty automatic answer. Weird, right? We should have expected some human to check appeals but it seems it’s not the case. Oh and account are deleted in 14 days, so it’s even more fucked up.I lost a 7 years old account and a discord server with many boosts (~14) this way and I never got an answer other than a bot one despite my tickers being still opened. I did a lot of search regarding it and it seems a lot of users had similar experience with the support team. They don’t care about appeal even if you share proof and stuff of your innocence/age."

1c5gttc,discordapp,Demonic-Angel13,Why have you been requested to verify with your id?Did you get in trouble due to age? Is it to be able to view nsfw? Other than these reasons I don't think there would be a reason to verify age or for it to be requested.Also be highly aware of who requested it and that it's actually legit. And you need to make sure you know why.Always ask yourself who and why and what channel. If you can't verify it's legit or has any purpose then it may not be worth the risk

1c5gttc,discordapp,thebebee,is this requested from discord themselves in a support ticket? otherwise this is some random person and don’t do that. if you are verifying your age in a ticket yes it is safe.

1c5gttc,discordapp,KalHasWaffles,you are being scammed
1c5gttc,discordapp,The_Bisexuwhale,"If you do verify your ID with a server always make sure to block out (not blur, use a method with 0% transparency) all information besides your picture/birthdate (depending on what the require). It cannot be guaranteed to be safe because you are basically giving your information to a random person. But, that makes it harder for anything to go wrong."
1c5gttc,discordapp,Samtino00,"I'd still say, don't give out personal identifying information to anyone other than a trusted company. The companies have legal obligations to handle that information a specific way. They aren't allowed to store it (unless they tell you) and they definitely can't manipulate or share it.Server moderators are not held to a standard like that, even if they're employees of some company. You volunteered private information in a public method (yes I believe DMs are still considered public as in no expectation of privacy)"

1iq2gyr,discordapp,_Kozloff_,why is this server 29+ in the first place?
1iq2gyr,discordapp,baltarius,My guess: they wanted a 30+ server but one of the gang was 29
1iq2gyr,discordapp,EmperorNihilus44,"Makes no sense to me. It’s full of 30 year olds acting like they are 12, so defeats the whole purpose of whatever they were trying to accomplish."
1iq2gyr,discordapp,Woofer210,"They are allowed to ig technically, but I would never send my gov ID to some random joe on some random server."
1iq2gyr,discordapp,klok_kaos,"Yeah this the thing, as a private club they can demand whatever they want for entry provided its not explicitly an illegal action that violates tos.Much like a night club can have a dress code, they can demand your ID or refise entry."
1iq2gyr,discordapp,DrTankHead,"This is fairly common in 18+ or 21+ servers. They more often than not aren't storing ur personal info and u can block out things like addr and name.For example, if a server is for adult things like NSFW art, nobody wants to find out that someone put them at risk to interact with a minor. This is just the server owner doing their best to cover everyone's asses.Now, that said I've never heard of a 29+ year old server... Seems weird. Like at that point what's the extra 8 years gonna do? Unless it is some dating thing for folks over 30, but i mean kinda weird. I'm gonna be the same person 3 years from now so why would it matter?Honestly it would be better IMO if discord did this natively and it wasn't sending this info to some rando. I would sooner trust discord to verify my age than some rando in a server. They make tools that just validate legitimacy of the ID and age and dont store data. Discord should do that and simply let there be an 18+ and 21+ switch in the server panel to restrict age server wide, or additionally properly block NSFW flagged channels this way"
1iq2gyr,discordapp,crocs_r_valid_shoes,"I used to have friends who helped run those 18+ and 21+ servers, and the majority of them 100% keep your ID saved in a private channel that normal users cannot see, and they will make fun of your appearance secretly too. Nobody should ever trust strangers with their ID, especially on discord."
1iq2gyr,discordapp,JaceTheSpaceNeko,"A lot of servers follow similar rules, but the most common set is “Show date of birth, show color on the ID, and write your tag next to the ID. You can cover anything else up.”Nothing too too bad about it, but some servers need it when it revolves around being an 18+ server."
1iq2gyr,discordapp,Shemsu_Hor_9,"It's not forbidden by Discord's Terms of Service but it's heavily discouraged. Personally, anyone asking for my ID can go fuck themselves. I don't trust random people in a shit-ass server."

1k3okd8,discordapp,deprevino,Maybe just use AI software that makes you look like an elderly man?If everywhere is going to force lazy AI solutions on us then you might as well use the same wave of tech to help against it.

1k708bk,discordapp,Dino_rawrrrrr,"Unless your server absolutely has to verify the age of members and has an extremely dedicated / loyal userbase, you stand to lose almost all your (new potential) members. Asking someone for their age is one thing, but requiring an ID is a huge leap just to be in a community server owned by a John Random.There's bots that can help with detecting alts, but you should seriously consider not ID checking unless you want to kill you community. You can do as part of your moderator application process though."
1k708bk,discordapp,EzStudioz,We only want to ID check / verify users who we accept as mods.
1k708bk,discordapp,IisTails,"If you have a developer, you can integrate stripe ID verification, note there is a cost to it, $0.50 per verification iirc. There are alt detection bots but they kinda suck and are a hassle for users"
1k708bk,discordapp,EzStudioz,Stripe is $1.50 for verification by the way. It's $0.50 to lookup an ID.
1k708bk,discordapp,MILO123PROYT,Anti-Alt bot: DoubleCounter(.gg)For verification you could do a quick interview with the accepted candidates in a voice chat so you can approximately guess their age based on their voice.
1k708bk,discordapp,Global_Sherbet_1773,"Double Counter sucks, it's too easy to bypass"
1k708bk,discordapp,EzStudioz,Am I able to use double counter on select users?
hxe7i6,discordapp,Purpzie,"All of that concern goes through the window and it feels lazy that they don't even bother to offer a system of verifying your age before any kind of termination / account lock.That's... literally what leads to account locks in the first place. You can very easily put in your birthday to verify your age. You only need your ID tochangewhat you've said on that exact screen.Also, saying that you're under 13 is indirectly verifying your age too. Discord is literally, legally required to ban you if you're under 13. It's your fault for saying that if you aren't actually that age.So congrats, this was already a thing before you even wrote this. I suggest researching before you post."
hxe7i6,discordapp,ReesesBees,"They ask for it to prevent underage users from joining. If you're underage and you lie about your age, then your account gets deleted; plain and simple.If you want toCHANGEyour birthday, you need to prove it with your ID to staff."
hxe7i6,discordapp,BannedByDiscord,"This is part of a bigger problem in the way Discord handles accounts in general. They do not care about their users. They don’t care that some people are very attached to their account, servers, and Discord friends, especially in times of COVID. They also don’t care that for some people, this is literally their support system, and yanking it away for stupid reasons can completely crash their mental health (not talking about myself, but someone I know nearly became suicidal after losing their account).Anyway, Discord has gotten so big they no longer care about individual users. Make a joke about your age? Get banned forever. Accidentally join a server where someone violated TOS? Get banned forever. Lost your codes for 2FA? Get banned forever. Don’t have a legit non-prepaid phone number that receives text messages? Get banned forever.It’s much easier to just blanket ban everyone than try to find alternate solutions to these problems, have a warning/escalation system, or a support team that consists of people and not bots."
roxpzt,discordapp,[deleted],"If you want a strong verification system, require users to provide a photo with the following:User is holding an ID with the photo, date of birth intact and everything else redacted.Users face clearly visible in the photo.Piece of paper (also held) containing the server name, users name, and a random word selected by the verifying admin."
roxpzt,discordapp,[deleted],If someone gives you their face for a verification  it's still not safe since you just got their private information. Because of that system you can get all of your accounts banned and the server too. It's easy to photoshop so all I can say is that there is no way to verificate users if they are 18 and still not breaking ToS. It's just better to set normal verification(with click of a button). The answer is:There is no real way to verify users if they are 18 with 100% success rate.
roxpzt,discordapp,Aurora_Beaurealis,"A server I was in did that, we needed to use our passport showing our picture and date of birth, along with our discord tag name. We would send that to a mod and after verification it would be deleted. Thing is it could have been someone else which is the problem.I would just go ahead with the verification and any minor found in the channels you ban them. They have broken the rules set up by the server and you are protecting yourself and the server. If they want to be in the server then they behave."
roxpzt,discordapp,Flyingbox,You're allowed. Users have to willingly provide id.
tf9fkr,discordapp,GiantMallard23,"I was just about to make a post about this, it's happening to me as well. Hope it's just a glitch and it gets fixed, scrolling is annoying"
tf9fkr,discordapp,proflopper,Seriously hope they fix this. I have about 5 years of adhd related muscle memory associated with scrolling up and then hitting esc to scroll back down again.
tf9fkr,discordapp,ThatSirWaffles,"The same thing happened to me, so for now I'm just using the middle click scroll to get down faster than just scrolling normally if that helps. Also spamming the ""End"" key seems to work but can be a bit buggy."
tf9fkr,discordapp,Meowthful127,"also having this problem. what i did was use an ahk script to bind my esc key to ctrl+end, although unfortunately, this doesn't mark the messages as read, it only goes to the bottom of the chat."
tf9fkr,discordapp,Ignifyre,Please change it back. I thought I was going crazy looking at my settings and keybinds to figure out if I messed something up.
1g30134,discordbots,Same_Doubt_6585,You need a valid photo ID to verify your identity to verify a bot. It also has to be part of a team and you can invite other members to the team with various roles. I'm not sure if other members of the team such as admins can apply for the verification or if you must be owner of the team(you can transfer ownership of the team). But as far as I see I don't see an actual age requirement looking.
1g30134,discordbots,daepikgoose,"I know about the id part, I was looking about bot verification on google and found smth about an age requirement, googleing it said I needed to be 16+ due to an agreement with Stripe"
1g30134,discordbots,yt_OP_islands_gamer,The owner is the only one that can verify it. The button doesnt work for other members
1g30134,discordbots,POTATO_SELLER,no one would easily do that... There are potential risk for them.Perhaps get one of your parents or older siblings to help you out with it.
1iywv8b,discordbots,baltarius,"Just set all your channels as NSFW, problem solved."

1iywv8b,discordbots,ce0d411bf7,"I've set up CarlBot on my server that works incredibly well for me without age verification.When users join, they're given the #unverified role by CarlBot. This restricts their view to #rules and #verify.In #Verify, there's a react role message (set up via Carlbot), asking ""What's your age?""13-15 16-17 18-20 etcIf a user selects an >18 role, Carlbot will give them the 'Minor' role which removes all view perms except to a channel called #read-me that explains that they're underage to view the server and gives them the ability to create a ticket to age verify.If they select an +18 role, it gives them the corresponding role and also gives them #member that grants access to the rest of the server"
1jtm21p,Discord_Bots,SwyfterThanU,"I’m sorry you’re facing this situation, that sucks.Two things I wanted to share are:I’d personally say 1-2 spam requests seems pretty low (or tolerable) for a server of your size, I feel like there will always be some bots/suspicious members who will sneak their way in and that you just have to continue doing what you can to keep your community safeI don’t think your bot idea will work. I’m willing to bet the dm spam bot accounts can detect whether the user they are interacting with is a bot or not, and using a regular Discord account for bot activity is against their TOS. If you want to keep your account (if it’s an OG account or something), I wouldn’t risk it."
1jtm21p,Discord_Bots,Comedian_Then,"The idea would be to have regular accounts disguised, with profile, bios, basically everything setup. And then the accounts would do minimum interaction on the server, like just reacting to messages. So would be ""preferable"" for these spambots to message.I dont know what's these bot's procedure, if they select only active accounts, or they just fetch the list from people on the server and start message one by one.Yeah it drastically dropped a lot, and I built a bot that auto-bans like young accounts, no profile pic, sus name, the bot judges the account based on the profile information. The downside is it has a lot of false positives, bot has tight settings, some people message me getting banned and they dont know why."
1jtm21p,Discord_Bots,DarthStarkGames,"Botting a user account, whilst doable with the API, is strictly prohibited and will get you banned."
1jtm21p,Discord_Bots,Ashley__09,wow ur so helpful
1jtm21p,Discord_Bots,KiritoKuroFaita,As you already said user bots are against the TOS. I think there is maybe a other way to do it. I will think about that and see what you could do. If you want you can dm and we can try to look further into it.
1jtm21p,Discord_Bots,TheRealSethV,"Quick question what is the joining process like for your server, any verification?"
1jtm21p,Discord_Bots,poon-patrol,"J setup a verification system for the server where there’s a hidden phrase somewhere in your rules that users have to send in a specific channel before they can view the server (there are bots that can do this but idk which ones off the top of my head)That will prevent any bots from joining your server, and if the problem persists then either your server isn’t really the problem or there’s someone doing it manually"
1jtm21p,Discord_Bots,uhlunaa,"why dont you just pause dms in the server? so people cant message each other without having them added, this way its up to the member if they want to add the bot or not. mods can still dm users, and bots can still dm users, however users cannot dm users without adding each other. this way whoever is sending bots to your server will realize it isnt working and stop, and eventually your server will stop being targeted and you can disable the pause on dms. (from personal experience in many big servers i own, this has worked) to enable it click the server drop down, click security actions, and enable “Pause DMs”"

1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Extra_Compote_7513,Huh? Where do you live? None of us had to do that from what I know of. Never heard of it at all.
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Ball_Full,"I live in the states.  The age verification through credit card only happened after I accidentally put in the wrong age. I've only been able to confirm one other instance of this happening whilst doing research trying find a solution for this issue. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling/removing from account nothing has worked so far.  In fact, as of writing this I still haven't received an email verification. Only other means for a solution I guess is going through the support that states having a 72 hour window for response times."
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Scourge_Azotar,Isnt the account your steam account?
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Ball_Full,"Yeah, it’s through steam. As far as i know it’s because I entered the wrong age so the game flagged my account as a minor, and because it was flagged as a minor it wanted verification through credit card from a “parent or guardian” (their words) giving permission to play the game(which I did with a visa gift card to be safe). It’s a weird way of verifying age/ consent from a legal guardian in my opinion, but that’s their process. There’s additional verification needed even after doing this in order to use voip/ add or invite friends which I’m still unable to do. I’m even unable to see steam friends through the game until this additional verification is done. (They email a code which I still haven’t received)."
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Hawkryl,Did you find a solution to resetting this? I was just clicking through and didn't notice until it asked for a credit card.
1eatm24,Dungeonborne,Ball_Full,nah still no solution other than entering cc info otherwise I suppose you can make a new steam account which I don’t plan on doing. I’ll continue playing dndr instead

It is illegal to sell a vape to a minor. The seller has committed a crime.  In fact, you can't even purchase and receive a vape through the mail without an adult signature upon delivery.Now, if what your so n actually purchased was an oxygen inhaler that looks like a vape, which is what I see for sale on eBay, that is legal and is not a vape and cannot be used to vape anything."

1f2dojy,Entrepreneur,JacobStyle,"You can use the Ripple Discord server to verify age anonymously, using givernment-issued IDs that only the server admins ever see, but I would advise against it. Knowing the identities of people you work with protects your business in many ways. It makes contracts enforceable and gives you recourse if the other person commits a crime against you or starts badmouthing you. Depending on where you live or sell your content, voice actors in animated adult videos may also be subject to age verification record keeping requirements."

146hyzv,escaperooms,MrCoolguy80,I would just call ahead and ask.  They likely need someone over 18 for liability.
146hyzv,escaperooms,Depressedcarrot67,"I know that a guardian needs to sign a waiver online and stuff like that, but yeah... I guess it's better to call and ask if it'll be okay for the 15 year old and if we need an adult to be present at some point. I'll do that tomorrow, thank you though!"
146hyzv,escaperooms,runnerd6,The waiver has a little check box and signature box from a legal guardian. You can probably just scribble a name in there and be fine. They just need it for insurance purposes.
146hyzv,escaperooms,Depressedcarrot67,"Alright, thank you!"
146hyzv,escaperooms,LeaderMindless3117,When going to red door if you are under 16 you need a legal guardian with you. If you are under 18 your legal guardian must go to the website and fill out an adult waiver and then click a box to add a minor and fill out that info. It doesn't matter which guardian does it (or at least the employees didn't care when I went to the one in Oklahoma)
146hyzv,escaperooms,Depressedcarrot67,"Got it, thank you! I' might still call just in case, but I'll see."
146hyzv,escaperooms,[deleted],I work at an escape room with an age limit (12-17 year olds need to be accompanied by an adult)We do this for 2 reasons:Our rooms are difficult so having someone who is an adult can be handyhealth and safetyliability
146hyzv,escaperooms,MuppetManiac,"Everyone needs a waiver. Anyone under 18 can’t sign a waiver because minors can’t sign legally enforceable contracts, so an adult has to do it for them.I’ve never been asked for ID, but I don’t look like a kid. If your 15 year old friend goes without an adult there is a chance they will be denied entry and there very likely won’t be a refund for their ticket. I wouldn’t risk it."
146hyzv,escaperooms,kitkat198,It honestly depends on the location.  If Red Door states that a parent or adult must be present just call to make sure.  It is likely that they will be fine with it.  Just make sure your friend's parents sign their waiver before you get there
7mqoo5,escaperooms,VampNightClub,"It's not a good idea to play with strangers in a large group. If it's 2 people and another 2 this has been ok for us, if it's an 6-10 person max room. Basically 2 couples, in an 8 person max room, was ok. The common problems are only ""potentially"" going to make it bad. Two we did with strangers were ""bad"", but both times that had to do with over stuffing the room. You can also get DRASTICALLY different skill levels, a group of ""newbs"" gets robbed of a lot of the puzzling, with a matching group of experienced players. Call the company and ask when they shut down booking for an empty room. It varies from till the last minute, to 1.5 hours before the time slot. This lets you wait until you are sure it's empty to book. I can't stress enough strangers are a gamble that could ruin a VERY expensive hour. Many (smart progressive minded) rooms are booked for solo groups now, they just charge a little more for 1/2 max, or so. Example it's $31 for 2-4 people, $27 for 4-6 people and say $25 for 8-10."
7mqoo5,escaperooms,varineq,I’ve done it a few times with strangers and it was fine. We actually got along with one group so well that we stay in touch and occasionally do escape rooms together.
7mqoo5,escaperooms,FrontierPsycho,"I live in Europe, where I hadn't even considered doing a room with strangers. Then I visited the US, where almost all rooms could only be booked  with strangers, except if one booked the entire room (and the few that didn't do this were more expensive and advertised it as a perk).We did one room with strangers, and fortunately we were enough people to completely book the second room we did.The one with strangers was weird, it took ten people and was very disjointed and had lots and lots of optional stuff to find, so that people could work all over the room all the time. At the same time, that meant it was very hard to solve the main puzzle. It didn't work for me. It was the first (and only, to date) room we didn't complete, and we didn't have as much fun.I can only imagine what it would be like to do a more regular sized room, four of us and two strangers, or three of us and three strangers. It, obviously, all depends on who you'll be matched with, which is the entire reason one should only go with their friends, as then you know what you're signing up for: with strangers, you can't. They can be much worse or much better than you, which makes for an awkward experience, IMHO.Or you could be lucky :-)"
7mqoo5,escaperooms,MuppetManiac,"Every time I’ve failed a room it’s been with a group of strangers. With my regular crew I can beat most any room. Strangers throw a kink in things. It’s doable, but certainly more difficult."
7mqoo5,escaperooms,blacjax,"As someone who currently works at an escape room I've probably seen every combination of group dynamic out there. For the most part what people in this thread have been saying is true-a group of strangers is a gamble; that being said you and your family do have some say in how it all works out.I'm sure ya'll are very nice people but remember that everyone in the room is escaping from the same room so for the time you're in the room these four strangers are now part of your group. Don't ignore them and just work within your family-introduce yourselves, crack a small joke, ask them what their experience is, etc. The groups that actively engage with the other group has a lot more fun (and a higher success rate) than those that choose to isolate them.Lastly, the rooms are kind of designed to accommodate the maximum number so having these extra hands might help.Good luck either way!"
7mqoo5,escaperooms,Bcashdaddy,"Think of it like going to the movies or a restaurant, or ball game. There will be other people. There might be kids. Could be good or bad. If you don't have a good experience, let the staff know and they should be able to help you find a solution."
7mqoo5,escaperooms,jondarmstr,"I've had a good time with other strangers, especially if they're experienced in escape rooms. Just be friendly and positive"
7mqoo5,escaperooms,Jah-Eazy,"First time I did an escape room it was with two of my friends, two sisters of one of those friends plus one of those sister's boyfriend. We were joined by four people who I think were like a sibling couple thing cause one couple was around our age and the other couple was like in high school. It was fun. They weren't weird or anything and the guy laughed at all my jokes lolI did another one with a club from my school. It was three others and I didn't really know them. But once it got going, it didn't really matter, though two of them were kinda just going along for the ride"
7mqoo5,escaperooms,EscapeWilmington,"I've actually won every single room I've played with strangers with the exception of one.Generally, playing with strangers is awesome and I think because there is no interruption or distraction through in-jokes and the like, stranger groups tend to be more focused on the goal.However, though the only bad experience I've had with children was in a private booking with a family - if you can avoid having kids in the room, do it."
7mqoo5,escaperooms,RygardBair,"Ultimately, it depends on the people, both you and the other team.  We've stopped booking 'party rooms', and now we only do private rooms similar to what @vampnightclub mentioned.Ultimately, we had fairly few issues with the mixed groups, generally everyone still gets into it, and had a great time, assuming the room itself is good.My personal preference had always been to play with just my group, and I always call escape rooms to try to arrange this one way or another, but sometimes you just have to go with it."
pkmwaw,escaperooms,MuppetManiac,We require a birth date on waivers as verification you are 18.
pkmwaw,escaperooms,Exit_exe_,"When I went to the escape room, I didn't need to verify I was 18. The only ""verification"" was when the team leader signed the wavier for safety reasons and took the team leader's driver license for ""verification purposes"" but it was for the code to the safe."
pkmwaw,escaperooms,AuShea,For us when you book online it asks you for your DOB aswell as our waiver form. Also in a case where we have a responsible suspicion that they put in a random birthday we swap out the lock for a last name or something similar

zpe9dx,escaperooms,Orjazzms,"Depends on the company. I would call and ask.The reason for the age limit is damage limitation. Kids tend to make more new and be more likely to break periods without adult supervision, but they may make an exception if you behave and act maturely.The limit may be 6, but they'll likely allow an adult be present in the room with you as a 7th, providing there are no safety or other limiting factors that prevent more. The 6 limit is usually just the maximum before it becomes a bit crowded and less fun for the players, but if one of the party is not participating in the puzzles, this is less of a concern."
zpe9dx,escaperooms,tomius,"16 minimum age... Even with an adult? I hope not, because that's insane."
zpe9dx,escaperooms,MuppetManiac,Depends on the room. I’ve seen some that were 21 plus for very good reason.
zpe9dx,escaperooms,Bunnypopsford,"They are mainly worried about you trashing the room, running around screaming, not engaging in the puzzles etc. So, don't do that and you'll be OK."
zpe9dx,escaperooms,TheRubester_tm,"Our rooms you have to be 16+ without an adult present to take responsibility for the group, however if someone is over the age they can consent to being the responsible party and sign as such for the under 16s. If we have a 12 year olds party for example we ask parents to listen to the safety briefing along with the kids and sign to say they take responsibility and the kids understand even if they are not going into the room. We do not check ID but we do ask. Best advice is to just call and ask, and if needed have an adult come along for the safety bit at the start then go grab a coffee or something."
svhlll,europe,johnnytads,The same happens in greece with age restricted videos on YouTube.Pornography is not age restricted tho.
svhlll,europe,wintrmt3,I think that's global or at least the whole EU.
svhlll,europe,Downtown_Shopping,For more context:France threatens to block five pornography websites unless they enforce age verification restrictionsThis was back in December so seems like they’ve complied. I’m not French but was using a French VPN server when I saw that. Thoughts?

1g44s3x,europrivacy,Significant-Okra-190,"Yeah, god forbid parents try raising their children. That's what smartphones are here for!"
1g44s3x,europrivacy,Overtilted,"Limiting teens from using social media requires being able to figure out the age of every social media user.Social media platforms do this already. It's one of the datapoints super important for advertisers. Remember you're the product of social media, so they need to know everything about you.That's why one should avoid social media...What the government is proposing is a national social media age verification scheme. Or, to put it plainly, every Australian is going to have to prove their age when they go online in a way that they never have before. Maybe it’s by showing government ID, a credit card, or some other way — whatever the method, it’s a bump that’s going to be felt by each of us.Maybe yes, maybe not.Again, social media already know the age of its users pretty well.Privacy needs to be balanced against other values, obviously.This is a very interesting case because there's tons of research that points towards the harm of social media on kids (and adults, for that matter)."

xrmq62,facebookdisabledme,[deleted],"I realized now I forgot the ""Basic guidelines"" I promised, but the thread was already getting very long.My recommendation to you would be to not give up.

I lost eleven years worth of personal photos and data because the download data button doesn't work. Like others here, I contacted the California AG and got an email from Rupert saying that my account would be restored if I supplied a new email address. I did. Over a month later, I got a response saying that the correct decision had been made and my account would remain permanently disabled.Is there anything left I can do?

1fbgz3t,facebook,[deleted],"Unfortunately until we have government step in and hold them accountable to their federal regulations, looks like nothing will happen. I'm a almost 20 year users (was a Uni student when Facebook started and got an account way back then). The fact they literally could give 0 effort towards restoring my hacked account is absolutely ridiculous to me and they actually legally have to give me back assess to a compromised account that has my sensitive information (Facebook requires sensitive information just to start an account). There is an interesting National Geographic doc on YouTube that will definitely get you wondering about the META security help and where they are located.. the reason they are rewarding the hackers could because they are the hackers in their off time. They basically collect our data and sell it to organized crime on the black market.. the doc said the data on the black market is more valuable than oil or gold now...https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jtrFTHlUJ5Q"

Spent days going through help and then finally paid for that check mark and 4 days later with a new email I got her account back. Just crazy how easy it is for them to get into meta. Cleaned her face book up and had to install ad manager to find them. There they added four users to her account so they just had to use their own user ID and passwords.That was fun to figure out as she never had an ad account.

So I did the video selfie to no avail, then I submitted two pieces of ID through the id confirmation area you mentioned; and finally got my id confirmed. HOWEVER, this still doesn't allow me to access marketplace.On a computer browser when trying to access facebook marketplace it reads:Marketplace isn't available to youThis might be because Marketplace isn't available in your country, you've just joined Facebook or your account doesn't meet our age and eligibility criteria.(button saying Learn more)On my phone when trying to acccess facebook marketplace, it shows a glimpse of the marketplace home page and then gets overlayed with a:Unable to confirm your ageIf you fail a video selfie verification, you'll be asked to try a new verificiation method. Verification methods vary by location and may not be available in your area.(button saying Learn more)I can almost navigate facebook marketplace on my phone, such as viewing saved items, if you press fast enough, but thats useless cos the overlay with the same message keeps popping up.When you try and go to their help guides and whatnot, their chatbot thingy asks do you want to upload Id? and you go yes. blah blah blah, then it tells you to log into facebook and follow the steps however upon clicking the link its just the facebook home page. Others have faced similar issues.PLUSthere is no where to upload ID specifically for marketplace, only for running ads about social issues, politics, economics. I knew this before submitting photo ID, but I was optimistic it would translate to marketplace after confirming that I am indeed an adult.I still don't have access to marketplace... I don't care if its ""processing"" somehow in the backend, it shows that my ID is confirmed, at least it should say ""waiting for human approval"" if that were the case.This is an absolutely dismal platform, especially since I need access to marketplace urgenlty to purchase stuff that I need soon; on top of that this is a company which is not small by any means whatsoever.

Like it is not clear, how it gain it's aims. There are still lots of unverified users and possibility to create new steam->faceit account any time you want (even during all this verification process u're asked weather this account is ""main"") and use it to ruin others game experience.There is a point about competitions and it is totally ok, but not for casual play.Generally, I've never counted ""smurfs"" as a problem (is it really important why someone plays better than you, cause he is talented or smurf, you just not good enough to deal with him?).I've heard different opinions yet still I'm not ok with sending my data to anyone to play computer game (especially if I don't really get the point).Anyway, as far as I understand there is no way to restore game queue availability for me without verification?Thank you, once again.Best regards."

wkty93,FAFSA,Embarrassed-Wrap-616,Yes right I am kind of on the same boat and would love to know how to answer this question I’m 22 now but became homeless right after high school and starting college.

wkty93,FAFSA,Lumpy-Step-5355,This is really late so idk if you’ll see this but I submitted my Fasfa stating I was homeless and they’re telling me to redo it without that because apparently that’s for only unaccompanied youth? I’m so confused right now and do not know what to do.
wkty93,FAFSA,Fun_Barber_8227,"Hey, I know this post is kind of old but I could use some guidance. I believe myself to have been at risk for homelessness, but I'm not sure if it counts, like you say. I only have my mom, no dad involvement, and she cannot afford to support me at all. She made around 40k for the 2023 tax year, but has to take care of my grandfather, bills, and other expenses. So she doesn’t and my boyfriend & I work together to support ourselves. My boyfriend wasn't working for some time and we were barely paying rent, but it always got paid. Even when he was working, paying rent was a struggle and continues to be an issue. However, we have never been evicted or been threatened to be evicted. He does not receive support from his parents either and we have a huge debt load. If he doesn't get a better paying job by the time his loan payments begin, we will not be able to afford rent. I am 23, so not quite old enough to qualify as independent on age only. Should I consider myself at risk of homelessness? Every time I try to mark it, FAFSA rejects my claim"

sgec00,FanFiction,Jojosbees,"As an adult in fandom, I don’t give a shit if minors are reading my PWP. I am aware people are curious, and you don’t suddenly discover the birds and the bees at 18. If a 15 year old comes across my appropriately tagged and rated fic and reads it, then it’s whatever. I’m not their mother. Literally the only time this bothers me is if they scream at me about how could I write X or why would I support AO3 or some other dumbass take. I’m on Tumblr too and I’ve seen just the dumbest statements. It’s not uncommon for people to argue that fics featuring XYZ shouldn’t be posted online or that we as adults should only act like a child is in hearing range and to do otherwise is to be at best a terrible person and at worst a predator yourself. It’s like they think there should be no adult spaces because god forbid a child stumble across it (saw one in the wild just yesterday). And no, it doesn’t matter if the person making this argument is 15 or 50 (though this is way more prevalent among the former). I have been told that I’m at least 25, so I should stop writing child porn because I’m a whole ass adult. A couple things: (A) I write Steve Rogers/Tony Stark, so wtf, and (B) Explaining why AO3 doesn’t moderate content is not pedophilia.When people are fed up with minors in fandom, what they’re really fed up with are others expecting that we cater to hypothetical minors who might stumble across our work. And honestly, if a Discord wants to stay 18+, then it should be allowed. Adults are allowed their private spaces to speak with other adults. It’s not that deep."
sgec00,FanFiction,Real_Myst,"Agreed 100%. I can't even begin to count the amount of ""if you're 25+ and still watch anime you need to get a life,"" or something along those lines that I've stumbled across on platforms like twitter.Like, why do these people feel the need to come out of the woodwork to start giving their unsolicited opinions? And there are many that go into spaces not intended for them for the sole purpose of ranting at people and giving the latest ""hot take"" that everyone else is parroting.These are some of the reasons I've seen that ""adults"" don't want ""minors"" in their spaces. And I hear a lot of these instances because I have a good friend in a certain fandom that is pretty toxic and they get attacked like every other day for a certain ship because the ""minors"" think it's inappropriate. Meanwhile, both characters of the ship are canonically adults so I don't even understand the problem. (Aside from one of the hot takes being age gaps are the root of evil no matter how small they are.)So, again, agreed. If people want their own private spaces, just leave them alone. Everyone doesn't have to be allowed everywhere."
sgec00,FanFiction,airawyn,"As an adult, I do not want to worry if everything I say or do is appropriate for children. And it isn't ""children are horrible"", it's that as an adult, I am ethically and legally required to behave a certain way in front of someone who is underage. People canlose their children, lose their jobs and go to jailfor providing NSFW material to people who are underage. Or for being queer in the presence of children, in some regions.""Minors DNI"" and ""18+"" are the fandom equivalent of carding for alcohol and porn in real life. There's a reason that bars are 21+, and it's not because kids melt in the presence of alcohol. It's so the bartender doesn't have to constantly check ids. It's so you can buy a beer for someone and not get fucking arrested. I've known Discords were saying the words ""anal sex"" is not permitted in the all-ages channels. Do you really have to ask why anyone would want an 18+ server?And if people get hostile about it, then that may have something to do with being frequently told that you can't have fanfic or discussions that are inappropriate for young minds, and that adults are required to be on their best behavior around minors, or in a space where minors might pass through. These, by the way, are frequently also the conversations in which adults are told to go back to their knitting and taxes because fandom doesn't belong to them. These aren't separate conversations.There was a court decision back in the 90s when the WWW became popular that had to decide if everything on the Web had to legally be safe for children. It was decided back then that the internet was for adults, and it remains that way today.(The shit with the gun is not okay, but I'm pretty sure it's in the minority of DNI warnings.)Look, I think teenagers should be able to think about, discuss, and have sex, but it's illegal and creepy for me to provide it to them, and I am not fucking interested in censoring myself in my fun spaces."
sgec00,FanFiction,BothWing3539,"Yeah, no, I've seen stuff all the time that...is the opposite of your experience. I got told to kill myself by antishippers. I've seen adults ganged up on for being in fandom at 35 by a bunch of minors. Who then proceeded to attack them for being autistic, because being autistic isn't an excuse for being creepy? Which is a true statement, but...just being an adult in fandom isn't creepy. I know that a lot of them are being manipulated but I also got manipulated in a similar way and I never told anyone to kill themselves about it. And I took responsibility once I was wiser. Considering that the vitriol adults in fandom display towards minors is a direct result of us being mistreated in a space we created, um, I'm not sure that blaming adults for doing something wrong, nebulously, is the way to go.I'd obviously prefer if the yelling at children went away, but...I get it."
sgec00,FanFiction,neongloom,"But for a community like fandom that is otherwise so zealous to be a home for minorities and people who don’t have any place they feel they belong, my disappointment is just so immense that it somehow seems to have become the “in” thing to do to discriminate against a whole group of people based on a characteristic that they have absolutely no influence over.My thing is, this very much applies to the people trying to chase anyone 18+ out of fandom spaces. Older fans don't have control over their age and for a lot of people it seems to be the ""in"" thing to crack nursing home jokes or belittle anything that comes out of their mouth because ""you're old enough to be someone's mother"" or ""don't you have a husband to take care of?"" All for the crime of enjoying fandom as an adult.I agree treating minors with that kind of hostility isn't cool but I can see where the defensiveness might have come from. Of course older fans are going to relish having their own spaces when so many kids are trying to push them out of the ones they originally inhabited. It doesn't justify it but it at least explains it. I just wish we could all coexist peacefully instead of creating all this distance between each other. Age never used to be a huge factor like this. It's sad this is where we've ended up."
sgec00,FanFiction,GraboidFarmer,"I’m 36 and I’ve been called a “senior citizen” and told to “stay in my own lane” by teens on tumblr. 😆 I was like, “Yeah, who do you think created the fandoms you’re into? Not kids, that’s for sure.” Little do they know they’ll be buying under-eye cream sooner than they think."
sgec00,FanFiction,plutoduchess,"People say minors DNI when they are predominantly NSFW because it is in actual crime to knowingly share NSFW material with someone under 18. It's not discrimination. It's a literal crime.Also I'm sorry, but I'm in my 20s. I don't want to hang out with kids. I want to hang out with other adults."
sgec00,FanFiction,Careful_Cut_8126,"People in one of my fandoms have been “exposed” for grooming and manipulating minors after literally just being friendly in a writerly space with them (think like 17 and maybe 23 as far as age differences go.) The adult writer creates nsfw content, there was a friendship fall out, and this is what it turned into. This is why adults don’t want to hang out online with teens even when it’s not nsfw content all the time. I don’t know how old you are OP but I’m going to assume you’re 18ish. Do you want to hang out with a 7 year old all the time? If you are around kids, you probably act differently and would have different conversations with other 18 year olds that aren’t even Bad conversations, but not great to have with a second grader."
sgec00,FanFiction,serralinda73,"I haven't come across this personally (I'm not active on any social media other than reddit) but I have seen people complaining about this issue - most people here seem to think the whole, ""Minors GTFO! Do Not Engage!"" is ridiculous and going overboard but many understand the paranoia as well.I have also seen a lot of people saying they get attacked or harassed about their story content that has minors doing...not so perfect things (not necessarily sex, but probably that most of the time). And a lot of adults seem to be running scared over the thought that having contact with a minor - even in a perfectly innocent conversation in the comments of a fic that just happens to have a few sex scenes - will somehow get them arrested or ""canceled"" for...idk, corrupting a minor, enticing them into a real-life hook-up, grooming, pedophilia. But all they're doing is having a conversation about writing 99% of the time.As if any mixture of sex and a minor (NOT sexwitha minor) is automatically a crime and you'll end up on the child molester watch list. Some adults are scared, really scared, of this or they don't want to deal with the drama/accusations. Suddenly, adults aren't supposed to write about minors having sex, think about it, age them up enough to legally have sex, remember that they got into some interesting situations themselves when they were younger...it's like a whole subsection of the populace has gone insane.Back in my teen days (a long time ago), if you went into adult spaces on the internet (like you do), you kept your mouth shut. We were aware we were trespassing in a space not meant for us so we did our best to keep on the downlow. There was no announcing of our age and then getting pissed off when we're called out for it. There was no attacking the adults and their adult spaces as if those are not supposed to exist. And then on top of all that crazy, to guilt adults for being adults and actually following the ""rules"" of how to be a good adult by keeping your adult stuff away from the kids... Does this make sense?""We want to go in there!"" followed by, ""OMG, what the hell did I just see in there?!"" Yeah...kind of the whole point of telling you to stay out in the first place. And because they're teens who have been raised by the internet and TV, they then think they're entitled to say adult things that make them uncomfortable shouldn't exist at all.To use fanfic as a metaphor - this is seeing a tag you know involves stuff you don't like, reading the fic anyway, then giving the author shit about writing it. So if writers are trying to guard their personal (online, but still personal) spaces by putting up disclaimers and warnings and insults...I think it's stupid and won't work anyway, but I can kind of understand why they do it.Sorry, I ranted and went off-topic. I just hate this stuff.This, in a country that has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates  of all the industrialized countries... Denial, anyone?"

I'm sure I interact with minors in the fandom, but the only ones Iknoware minors are the ones that won't shut up about how we need to change our discoursebecause they are there. So when I bitch about minors, it's only the ones that use their age as a sword to force others to change, and as a shield to protect themselves from having to change. Why is it only them? Because the rest don't make their age an issue. They act like adults."

kokgrt,FemaleDatingStrategy,JelielAllelle,"Holy shit. My ex did the same thing. I actually didn’t even find out until we were broken up. He had a FEW different Facebook accounts, and on every single one of them, he had me blocked. The craziest thing about that is we were strictly platonic friends for 1.5 years before we ever dated, and he had to have blocked me almost instantly after first meeting me, bc I looked him up the next day, then asked for his socials that he “didn’t have.”  That is calculated. Men truly suck."
kokgrt,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted],"OP, thank you for taking the time to sit down and post all of this; women are often not taught strategies to sniff out unfaithful liars in favor of being ""understanding"" and ""nurturing"" and all the other toxic shit that gets heaped on us from childhood onward.The idea of the craaaaazy~ overly suspicious woman is so ingrained into society and it is SO damaging to our perceptions of reality and to our reputations. To listen to one's intuition and dig when they see any of these signs out of a man is often regarded as crazy and paranoid, and men are often waiting until we reveal what we know before denying the truth, accusing us of ""snooping and being deceptive"" and then using it as an excuse to dump us as quickly as humanly possibly so they don't have to face a second more of our displeasure.Men who cheat are cowards. End of story. They're a lot of other things, too, but chiefly they are fearful and cowardly losers and they will never change. If they managed to get by with it once (even if it ended in discovery), they know they can do it again. They can and they will.Please stay in recovery, OP. Support groups, therapy, whatever it takes."
kokgrt,FemaleDatingStrategy,level_up_always,"I was also raised very patriarchal, and was told since birth that  certain things were only achievable via a man, even if I was deeply  ambitious when young.Also former swer, I relate to this a lot and it's not just exclusive to sw but I think that is how a lot of us end up in it because we want to be ambitious and achieve and see the patriarchal programming and it seems like the best way to maximize and work that ambition in it's own fucked up wayAlso wanted to add some additional points from my own experience (I agree with all of yours)- the classic 'man staying late after work': they've gotten smarter than that as a lot of them want to see you early in the day like wayyy early bc it's less suspicious leaving early for work then coming home late- they like to tell the sw how much they love their wives, and want validation from the sw that they aren't the piece of shit they truly are. i think they actually believe their own bullshit which is the scariest part of the whole thingI hope that you will take your time to heal and pursue your dreams. It's never too late and your story can help others. It's a weird position to be in having been a former sw and critical of it while also wanting to support women themselves who have been in similar predicaments because so much of the rhetoric (even on this sub sometimes unfortunately) is to demonize the women or in libfem circles 'sEx pOsiTiViTy' there is not a lot of nuance of understanding why we choose to do certain things but at the same time (at least in my case) felt brainwashed into it.edit: and another thing - NEVER go 50/50 if you want another reason not to because they literally use that extra money to spend on other women and in fact find ways to spend less/have her cover more so they have more discretionary income to spend on them. don't make it any easier. so if he starts wanting to have more 'equality' or whatever the fuck trying to get you to earn more etc. that is another sign he's trying to free up his finances to spend on someone else"
kokgrt,FemaleDatingStrategy,[deleted],"Thank you so much for writing this out. I appreciate your insight.Also, if you decide to become a lawyer, you could specialize in helping women divorce these men and men's narcissistic behaviors. Women need lawyers who understand the levels of manipulation men put women through and how wrecked women get in the process."
kokgrt,FemaleDatingStrategy,temproaryusername,"Wow. Incredible. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!These stories need to be heard, and I know how FDS is spilt on that idea, so thank-you for your bravery.I would like to emphasize to the young girls reading this...........It means NOTHING to make money off being sexy, sexual, and/or subservient to men. Any woman can do it; the sexual appetite of men in this world is deep and endless. You put your own self-worth at risk, as well as setting back the progress of your sisters. If women are groomed from childhood to believe their only worth lies in their sexuality, and this idea is reinforced through the actions of women; how many female Drs, Tradespeople, Lawyers, Politicians, CEOs are we losing out on each generation?I also thank OP bc I know now for sure my ex was cheating. I have been having difficulties since my breakup (months ago) accepting the fact that my ex lied (and continues to deny) that he was cheating on me. It is incomprehensible to me how people can bald-face lie to ones they love and maintain a secret life with virtually no shame. Your story proves to me without a doubt he was capable of such.😥 As always, this stuff is hard to hear, but thank goodness for FDS."

1i20s3n,fourthwavewomen,goddamitletmesleep,"While age verification is a necessary step, it is far from a solution. The broader issue remains the same: pornography is a billion-dollar industry built on the degradation, exploitation and objectification of women. Until that reality is confronted head-on, no legal restriction will be enough to counteract its damage.The widespread normalization of pornography has fueled a culture where sexual violence, misogyny and exploitation are dressed up as ""entertainment."" Porn isn't just harmful to children - it's harmful to everyone, particularly women. It shapes how men view sex and relationships, warping their expectations and increasing demand for violent, degrading content. It shapes how women perceive themselves, their bodies and their boundaries. Studies have shown links between porn consumption and increased male sexual aggression, yet the industry remains largely unregulated. The bigger fight isn't just about restricting access...it’s about dismantling the lie that pornography is harmless, empowering, or just another form of entertainment."
1i20s3n,fourthwavewomen,sapphisticated413,"removing a relatively large demographic of viewers, teenage boys, will still be a large hit to the industry. any drop in production is a good thing"

1i20s3n,fourthwavewomen,chaoticfia,Not feeling confident about the level of understanding - one of the older justices asked if Pornhub had essays on its website like Playboy used to(yes there's technical legal reasons behind the question but i'm still finding it hilarious he even asked regardless)
1i20s3n,fourthwavewomen,yellowblpssoms,Lol! It is hilarious
1i20s3n,fourthwavewomen,chaoticfia,"clarifying some of the legal technicalities: the SC isn't evaluating if it's constitutional to have ANY age block, or judging 1A stuff, (at least as far as I'm aware), but rather evaluating if the Texas standard (more than 1/3 adult content) is too broad (which tbh it might - they don't define what constitutes 1/3: 1/3 of pages, 1/3 of bytes, 1/3 of user traffic? plus it will apply to sites w up to 2/3 non-adult content, so there's a decent chance it might be struck down for being too broad, and the law may be passed with a revised scope (ie. more than 1/2 of user traffic))"
1i20s3n,fourthwavewomen,yellowblpssoms,"With greater access to technology and AI, I think it's going to get easier to create porn...abnormal and weird porn especially.

1g5ayf5,frenchie,KimberlyElaineS,"She’s gorgeous! I’d go by what a frenchie familiar vet says, they usually age by their teeth  and hair ( I think by how much white or grey that they have) mine is almost seven and her muzzle and chin has a bit of whiteness your baby’s muzzle looks pretty dark so she’s younger than that."
1g5ayf5,frenchie,Odd_Gain_7409,Thank you for the feedback!
1g5ayf5,frenchie,Wilted_fap_sock,"Hard to tell from looks alone. I'd imagine the vet came to that conclusion by looking at her teeth, among other things. The vet is likely in the ballpark."

1g5ayf5,frenchie,ChelseyT85,"When I rescued my baby, I was told that she was 3-4 years old. The vet took one look at her teeth and said she was 6. I was able to get previous vet records down the road, and it turned out that she was exactly 6 when I had first taken her to the vet."
1g5ayf5,frenchie,lammy1124,My guess is somewhere between 3 and 5. She’s definitely had at least 1 litter of pups based on her larger nipples and breeders usually start breeding when they are around 2-3 years of age. But like others have said the vet usually bases it off the teeth and they’re usually pretty close.Edited to add: she’s adorable 🥰

This is entirely allowed by the app stores.  So long as your rewards have no real world value, you are in the clear.  You do however need to require users to pass an age verification.  All this means in practice is asking them if they are 18 or older, and saving that to the users profile."

By default (at least in the US) you need to be at least 18 to have a credit card.I'm assuming there's some sort of virtual currency involved in your game already or there isn't much incentive to use a gambling mechanic in the first place.
ttx4md,gamedev,GreenCarpetsL,"Unless you use some kind of identification software which looks at people's passport/license, it's easier just to have term and conditions and an accept button right when the game loads including the terms underneath so that it's clear as day.

16h8bs5,GameStop,VeryTiredDeer,"When I was still a holiday hire, my store manager was very strict about ID’ing for M rated games. I was working with him and my assistant manager this shift.A woman, clearly in her 80’s, was buying World at War for her grandson for Christmas. I went through the “blood, violence, gore, etc” disclaimer and skipped the pos prompt for ID. My manager steps over and whispers “ID” to me, so I ask for her ID, and she bursted out laughing, causing me and the assistant manager to burst out laughing. In his embarrassment, the SM retired to his desk in the back with a “very well hidden” flask of whiskey he emptied into his coffee.After SM went to the back the woman said something to the effect of “does your manager know that the next time I’ll get id’d is when my family visits me in the morgue.” She, her daughter, and her grandson were regulars, I later found out.I guess the situation made such an impression on her that she’s hand over her license even when buying E rated titles just to fuck with me.This was 2008-2009 so I have my doubts she’s still alive, but I’ll never forget her, even as a complete stranger"

We joked about it after the fact."
16h8bs5,GameStop,Due_Raspberry_8521,One way I used to go about it is that I would apologize and point to the camera and just say I have to check ID since I have it watching me and I luckily never had anyone complain about me checking for their ID.

16h8bs5,GameStop,09dollface,Do you guys ID for using points as well? The last time I was in I only bought a plushie (went for something else but wasn't able to get it) but used a ton of points and got asked to show it.

If, hypothetically, the user finds it disagreeable to let the gamer group chat app analyze their facial features, they can instead scan a QR code with their phone, which leads to a page where they can upload a scan of their government-issued identification as proof of their age group.After providing either a face or ID scan, the user will receive a notification about their age verification status via a DM from Discord's official profile. Discord says the process ""typically takes just a few minutes."" Users will only need to verify their age once, but can retry the process or submit an appeal if they believe their age has been verified incorrectly.Recent years have seen the UK and Australia join a trend of governments adopting stricter age verification requirements for web platforms with the intent of protecting children from harmful content. In 2023, the UK's Online Safety Act entered into law, requiring websites and platforms that might host explicit content to enforce ""robust"" user age limits. Last year, Australia's parliament passed a ban preventing children under 16 from using social media. The ban is due to take effect in December 2025.While the purported intent of these measures is to protect children, digital rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation say that they undermine online privacy, security, and free expression, going so far as calling the Online Safety Act ""a blueprint for oppression around the world""—in part due to their reliance on ""unreliable tools like biometric scanners.""Discord, at least, says it won't maintain a record of age verification scans.""The information you share to power the age verification method that you choose is only used for the one-time age verification process and is not stored by Discord or its vendor,"" Discord says. ""For Face Scan, the solution our vendor uses operates on-device, which means there is no collection of any biometric information when you scan your face. For ID verification, the scan of your ID is deleted upon verification.""Based on screenshots on the support page, the age verification vendors in question are k-ID and Veratad.The k-ID website says it provides technology that ""enables publishers and platforms to stay compliant with the latest global privacy and safety regulations."" It's also got a lot of imagery with that pseudo-Pixar AI-generated stink on it, including one boy with truly inscrutable footwear.Veratad, meanwhile, says it provides ""customer identity verification solutions"" by ""bringing together the World's most disruptive IDV tech."" To soothe the fears of anyone who might be wondering what ""disruption"" entails when it involves processing your facial geometry, Veratad provides a reassuring image of a computer spraying fluorescent dots all over a guy's face like it's calculating a targeting solution for its onboard ordnance package."

3tlv8j,gaming,DJKrafty,"Holy shit man, Sony needs to address this, especially if you used a dev unit. You obviously have enough info of the inner workings and have been a loyal consumer. They need to make this right."
3tlv8j,gaming,InterimFatGuy,If hackers are trying to breach your bank account you should probably talk to the police/FBI
3tlv8j,gaming,ABetterKamahl1234,"I do just want to comment on your ""Inconvenience"" thing. CS reps are NEVER allowed to say an issue is beyond that. It means their jobs.We know it's worse than that. But we are restricted by things to keep our compliance to ensure we're not fired.(not commenting on any abilities for them to help or whatever, just the inconvenience thing)"
3tlv8j,gaming,Mystical_17,"This is why on any gaming account I own I never attach credit card or personal info (or as little personal info as possible). I only use prepaid and I prefer hard copy game discs over digital so if in the catastrophic event my account gets nuked I can make a new account and my biggest worry is re-installing games as opposed to having an entire digital library stolen. People seem to think when someone gets hacked on PSN or xbox they ""gave their account info away to phishing scams"". This isn't the case. There are ALWAYS loopholes, they may not be as easy to see by they can exist. Several years ago there was some stupid xbl EA loophole where hackers could steal accounts with the use of emails that were attached to the origin thing and use the money on accounts for some piece of crap FIFA microtransactions. Sadly my account got stolen despite the fact I never played a fifa game in my life but I had played battlefield 3 (and EA game). I was quick to recover because I checked my email one day and noticed a request for password and I got my account back since I have several safeguards in place.They stole all my 4000 ms points but I only use prepaid cards. I heard of others who had hundreds of dollars spent because of attached cardsHackers are nothing but a bunch of low life losers who apparently have no morals when it comes to stealing other people's stuff. They are willing to steal money from other people who are fellow gamers and demolish friends list (sometimes leaving nasty messages before removing the friends) only for the benefit of themselves. It sucks what happened to you and after reading that chat log of the hacker you posted it makes me mad how much of piece of work he thinks he is."

Xbox actually takes these very serious and if there is any sign of possible UA or account theft they send it to the ua escalations team to fully investigate. Can't get to much into it without potentially crossing confidentiality stuff, but just wow.Also want to try and correct something. These are in no way hackers, they are phishers and there is a big difference. Phishers know the questions to ask for social engineering to get the answers they need and once they have them they call back in to support and provide the right info to gain access. Hackers don't need to do this. Not trying to be that guy, just helping people better understand how it works."

3tlv8j,gaming,AsthmaBlows,"Someone hacked into my profile and spent 100 dollars on NBA VC, I had to call them and get my password changed but because I didn't have the original serial number from the very first PS3 I had (in 2009 it got YLOD so I threw it in the garbage) they couldn't do anything but ban the account and I lost everything I purchased.I gave them my email, password, he'll, I even sent them my ID picture and verified the credit card and they still wouldn't give me my account back.So I'm locked out if I ever want to use my account again which has hundreds of dollars of purchased content on it. Fuck Sony and their customer service. I think I'll stick to my xbox and never use credit cards again."
3tlv8j,gaming,MrFix-it,"Sony customer service might be the worst of any company I've ever come in contact with. If I were you, I would seriously consider some form of lawsuit. Maybe go onto Twitter and spam some execs. I've seen issues on Microsoft's side where Major Nelson has stepped in and provided some help. Just reading your post pissed me off. I love my ps4, but not enough to risk my personal information. Sony should be better than that; especially after that big hack a year ago."

yp4j9f,GenderGP,Leila-Ilo,"Age verification is so frustrating! Sorry to hear it’s giving you such grief. On the note of ‘AgeChecked’ is it possible you’ve managed to get to the wrong page? It was free to use when I used it, albeit that being a year ago.Looking  at their site they charge £35 a month (for 100 age checks) for businesses accounts to use their services so they can verify the age of their customers, definitely not a charge for individual customers.Regarding paper prescription, IF you’re from the UK be prepared to go on a pharmacy hunt as they’ve been known to be a bit hit and miss when submitting gendergp paper prescriptions, using clearchemist (without the verification frustrations) is definitely the more convenient and generally time saving route."
yp4j9f,GenderGP,venusdoesnotexist,"It's literally impossible to find a free way to use it, I can't find a simple sign up for an individual costumer at all!

yp4j9f,GenderGP,venusdoesnotexist,"I have the answer! I ended up phoning clear chemist and this is how to sort it out. When you get to the check-out and then it asks you for age verification, click the 'x' at the top corner and don't worry with what it says, once you click off you can actually just click to buy it again and you can buy it. Just make sure to email clear chemist's email with the order number you'll later get as well as some proof of I.D. and age! :)"

19aw2ll,GMail,KirikoSleepyBabe,So update on that.. my mom’s boyfriend ended up factory reseting the phone and then uploaded my moms drivers license the picture is not included and the DL number is covered so I am not sure how badly this is messed up. I sort of knew this was a scam to begin with but didn’t know about the safe mode feature I will try that and see if it gets anywhere because she used two phone numbers linked recently deleted the original number as she no longer has access to that number and the newest number is some how not the primary number google asks for even though she had removed it.Knowing now she is victim of a scam really terrifies me as she uses the same email for everything (not sure about same password for everything but most likely)I really hope I can fix this for her as she only uses it on her phone but I might be too late.

1geg1gv,GorillaTag,av3ncreeperYt,No idea if this is an actual thing but maybe they hadnt played since it was disabled so it just gave the pop up anyway (or they just posted this really late)

1geg1gv,GorillaTag,StellaLikesGames,"Hello Electronic! When is Gorilla Tag releasing for FreeBSD? - Much love, Stella"
1geg1gv,GorillaTag,Ok-Employee-587,Hello electronic I’ve been having issues with gorilla tag this started happening on November 1st where when I logged in it asked me for my age I put in 14 which is my real age and as I usually do I go to computer to go in a private to practise but i couldn’t because it said I was on a managed account which my parents have not managed it and it also said put in code at the k-Id website but there was no code on computer so now I’m just really concerned I can’t change my name or see people’s names I can’t buy anything and my cosmetics are gone I also can only play in pubs please help thank you
1geg1gv,GorillaTag,ElectronicWall,Can you make sure you are on the latest verson.?One way to ensure it is the latest version is to remove the game and reinstall and see if there is any popups.
1geg1gv,GorillaTag,little_brown_bat,yes. I uninstalled then reinstalled. Version is 1.1.91 still asking to verify my age.
1k698wz,growtopia,croco_chomp,"it doesn’t work at all. tried my debit/credit and every government license i have. i contacted ubisoft and they said to reinstall the app to bypass the age verification.as far as i know, the verification is tied to the client side and not your account so you could also try playing on a different device assuming you put your age to over 18 when you first installed the app"
1k698wz,growtopia,umight,"In my experience, trying different devices didn’t remove the age verification for me. However, other accounts worked on the same devices"

l23dxl,IAmA,FaradayEffect,"What are your thoughts on AWS's DocumentDB?Back when I used to admin a MongoDB cluster it took literally 12-24 hours to sync a replica. I tried an rsync disk level copy first so it wouldn't have to sync as much data, but it still took hours before the replica would be ready. I even tried MongoDB Atlas: once again it was hours before the replica was ready. This was significant issue for me.I don't use Mongo anymore, but I experimented with DocumentDB a while back and I really liked how their compute and storage are decoupled so that you can add more replicas almost instantly rather than taking hours of sync time.Has this been improved in Atlas yet?

Loved it.Tried again last year, and it was horrific.  Outdated presentations, incorrect answers, incomplete instructions for the assignments.  And the proctors; omg the proctors.  They were not helpful in any sense of the word, and actively belittled students for asking legitimate questions.  Or repeatedly killed threads that had identical questions from multiple students, and then re-killed the thread when it was reposted.  And this is not even addressing the dropout rate based on Vagrant/Virtualbox, which has it s own chapter of technical debt (not yours, but your choice to go that route).In a nutshell, it seems the product is growing faster than the curriculum is being updated.  It also seems that proctors are being chosen based on something other than teaching/interpersonal skills.Is the brass at Mongo aware of the decline in quality of this project?

1fjawlf,imvu,Random_throw78892,I want a response like this from imvu support😭✋🏽instead 13 later I'm rapidly aging from the stress of having to explain the same thing again
1fjawlf,imvu,Potential-Mammoth-12,what issue are you trying to resolve? i've personally never had difficulty with support but maybe i've just gotten lucky
1fjawlf,imvu,Random_throw78892,"I'm trying to receive payments for offers I completed. One of the offers was levelling up in a game. I never received payment for level 15 but I did for level 20 and 30 and for some reason I'm being told I didn't complete the offer. Despite the fact that that doesn't physically make sense. The other offer said to complete a certain room, I took ss of the game where it even said completed. I have ss of emails from the game saying I either to contact imvu support or that I indeed completed the offer and again contact imvu support and I've shown them this and they're asking for my fyber id and now digital turbine id and when I ask what those are and how to get it for them, they ignore me. Just recently I got a response stating I didn't read the email correctly and I didn't complete the offer.. So reasonably I start highlighting parts of each ss, the level offer had 2 other payment task and literally say optional but for some reason they don't see that part. I highlight the part in the email where support from the other game tells me to contact imvu support and even the part where they say I completed the task. Being gaslighted again and again that I didn't complete the offer that I in fact very much completed is so strange to me"

10zuzix,IRS,QuailAffectionate652,"I just got the letter today, and it won't let me do it online, so I'm calling Monday. Any tips, please?"
10zuzix,IRS,BigponyRL,Yeah you’re good! You got the letter so that’s a plus; like I said in the post I called and did it over the phone without the letter but took 8 tries because I didn’t have the letter! All the letter does is give you a 14 digit verification code they’ll ask for over the phone maybe and verify you in 5min with like 5 questions.
10zuzix,IRS,Conclusion_Scared,"Check your mailboxes. I'm in the state of Virginia and I called and they told me to verify myself via a letter they mailed me. I did that online and the gut said after they get it will be released.When I called back the lady said it could take up to 4 weeks even though I filed electronically and sent all my verifications via the website on the back of the letter.So, not sure if it's being held because of Pather as I am. I'm an 05er and last year I was a 06er. My process date was 2-28-22 issued on 2-24-22.I'm hoping this is the same 4 days early as my process date this year is 2-20-23. Hope it hits on 2-16-23 that's 4 days sooner. But who knows?"
10zuzix,IRS,BigponyRL,"Yeah the letter will tell you to go online and verify or call. They just don’t want to help you and they can actually do it over the phone, it just takes several calls or maybe two calls and get some one else to verify you"

1ajoj6e,IRS,Ok_Equivalent8004,"I'm sharing this update just in case anyone comes across this search and needs this help. If you are locked out of idme due to phone number change or other MFA issues, you can attempt to use your facebook account to login (make sure the email address on your idme account is the same one on facebook), it will eventually say that you already have an account & take you right back to the idme sign in page, but now you should see a link under the password box that says ""lost all access to your MFAs, click here."" Once you click the link, you can update your phone number and choose a new MFA. I recommend using the app codes, as a new MFA, so much easier and less risk in the event your number changes in the future. & idme never contacted me back to assist. I tried this for the hell of it and that worked."
1ajoj6e,IRS,erinflowers,you just saved me from two weeks of frustration i've been going through waiting for a response from them. Thank you so much!!for anyone else struggling another note if you try facebook and it says it's not available at the time try using the google sign in option instead as long as it's the same email you have for yourid.meaccount

1ajoj6e,IRS,Ok_Equivalent8004,"hate them, if they are going to be used for government services then they need to be regulated. Seems they pick and choose when providing efficient customer service. I remember contacting their customer service because I was locked out of my account and needed to verify my veteran status so I could get free seaworld tickets. I contacted them 4 months in advance, even noted I was requesting help so I could obtain park tickets for a visit in 4 months. It took them 6 months to get back to me, I totally forgot about it by then, and even then, they replied with a generic response. I then asked them to delete my account several times before I ultimately gave up. Now, it's the same bs, requested assistance getting into that same account for IRS purposes and only getting generic responses. Why can't the government pay for their own verification software, isn't contracting more expensive? As long as they've been around, it puzzles me why they still don't have a resolution for account access when your number changes. It's not that dang hard, answer security questions, do the facial thing, boom update your phone number."
1ajoj6e,IRS,Sad_Picture3642,"An absolute joke, supper inefficient and bugged."
1ajoj6e,IRS,GaryChalmers,I made the mistake of using these clowns today.  I thought filing directly through the IRS would be simple.  Instead I continuously got my documents rejected and then they are going to make me wait an hour and a half just to verify my identity via video call.  I should have just used a third party tax site that offers free filing.  I have zero doubt that the people who founded this company have a personal relationship with some government official that gave them their contract.  Cronyism and corruption at it's finest.
1ajoj6e,IRS,B2utyyo,I am so angry about it. It is keeping me from even verifying. I want my money
1ajoj6e,IRS,pixxelzombie,The service is very shitty. My wife has been trying to get a hold of someone for the past 10 days. There is an email on my wife's account that we DO NOT recognize and there doesn't appear a way to reset that without assistance from IDme.

1jdzuiv,IRS,Mermaid_Juice92,Problem is they tell me not to call until AFTER the nine weeks is up. They refused to tell me anything before the 21 days too so I requested letter before 21 days was up and it’s been two weeks on Thursday with no update. They yell at me and tell me I’m in the wrong for even calling because it clearly says to give them 9 weeks and they can’t do anything or tell me anything until then (IDK WHY SOMEONE DOWNVOTE ME BUT MY COMMENT WASNT RUDE NOR WAS I PUTTING ANYONE DOWN THIS IS JUST WHAT IM BEING TOLD!!!)
1jdzuiv,IRS,Unlucky-Ad6799,"So Fun Fact: There is a person or people, who literally came on this post to downvote all of the comments left under it, and also the post itself. The weird part, I’m advocating for you to get your refund in a timely manner.The person is either a person who stalks the IRS subreddit page (waiting for their refund) but has their nose 👃🏽 in the sky like they are so much better than the rest of you.Or an IRS employee, that feels like going hard for the IRS ( which is the same IRS currently firing them by the boat loads) will somehow prove their loyalty to a company that has absolutely no loyalty to them."
1jdzuiv,IRS,Cool-College-7095,Great post. I filed 1/31 accepted 2/1 my transcript was blank so 2/23 I called they told me a letter was sent out 2/20… received letter 3/6 verified identity same day online. Then called 3/12 and verified over the phone bc my transcript was still blank. They asked me a few questions and let me know everything went through. Well my transcript is still blank as of 3/18… I have no code or anything this never happened to me before.
1jdzuiv,IRS,Morbid_Joke710,"I filed 1/27/25, verified 2/18/25 nothing updated until last week and I now have a 570 code on my transcript so I called the IRS and they are soooo difficult to get a hold of a human but the lady I spoke with was very nice and as helpful as the stupid IRS system would let her be and she told me that everything looks good on her end - the hold came off my account on 2/21/25 but that is why there is a 570 code on my transcript - because of the ID verification hold which is so stupid - i am praying so very hard I get 846 DDD this week but all she could tell me was it could take the whole 9 weeks  - she said if I do not receive my refund by 4/25/25 then give them a call back theni want to pull my hair out lol. To anyone that hasn't received their refund yet, I will add you to my prayers and begging of the universe that we receive good news this week lol!"
1jdzuiv,IRS,Medical-Date2141,I agree.... last year I had my refund by 2-21..... I just got the verification letter Saturday and did it..... now waiting.... again.... utter bs

1jdzuiv,IRS,Unlucky-Ad6799,"Hey thanks for stopping by, and to answer your question, no not at all. However, I remain solid and firmly on my perspective, the verification process could be way less complicated. The Verification process sounds like we live in the 1990’s opposed to the age of technology in which we do.Fraud has been happening since the hands of time, and fraud will continue to happen until time and the earth itself, stops existing.We are all for helping to combat fraud, but in an effort to combat fraud, it shouldn’t extend wait times beyond normal processing.Every system that is made by the government, is not the best system for protecting people. Sometimes they do get it wrong, people are flawed, correct ? And the same people making these systems are jus regular people.I do not see the problem with questioning the system. In order to improve any process or system put in place by any authority, people must voice their concerns and problems.Because the system of verification was put in place to protect those very individuals against fraud, but it is also causing a significant delay and can be improved. Any system or procedures can always be improved, correct ?But everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and I also respect your position as well."

lzb2wl,IRS,Willing-Fault-9673,"Today is 5/21/21 - My return was e-filed and accepted 4/21/21. On WMR it said it was being processed. Then about 10 days ago WMR changed to ""We cannot provide any information about your refund."" Then I received the 5071c letter on 5/14 asking me to verify my identity. Thewww.idverify.irs.govtool did not work. I had an IRS account set up before all of this. Tool said it could not process my verification. Called number about 40 times and it wouldn't let me through. Called to make an appointment to verify in person. There were no appointments available within a 50 mile radius through July 30th. They couldn't look any further out. On the 5071c letter there is a number for a Tax Advocate (TAS). Called on 5/20 and waited on hold 30 mins for TAS. He was very nice and put me through to the Verification Hotline directly so that I would not get the ""cannot take your call due to high call volume"" hang up. Waited on hold another 40 mins and spoke to the dept. that verifies ID. He asked me details about my 2020 and 2019 tax returns, my parents names moms maiden name, details on a W-2 and the usual personal ID info. He cleared the hold on my return. I will update when I get my DD or DDD.UPDATE: Got my DDD 8 days after ID verify.  My DDD is 14 days after ID Verify. Before yesterday 5/20/21, the WMR tool did not recognize me, then today it recognized me and gave me a DDD"

To download the US version of LINE, you need a US based iCloud account (for apple) and download from the us Apple App Store, directly. You can use the same account for your Japanese version of Line in the American version of Line.

1gll89q,japanresidents,Indoctrinator,"Same. I can’t remember, but there’s definitely been a few apps that I just didn’t use because I didn’t feel comfortable sending them a picture of the front and back of my ID.I will say, that sometimes I think I worry a bit too much about it, because, like I said, all my information is out there for sale already I’m sure. But if I can limit my exposure as much as I can, I’d like to.I also feel like there should be way easier ways to verify me. Like, in Japan, I should just be able to give a phone number, and the company can check the phone numbers registration, see who is registered, and all my information is probably there anyways."

It's no just a matter of privacy and doesn't matter the government has facial data.There's a reason many systems use hardware-level biometric keys."
1k9l9qv,korea,typeryu,"You bring up a very good question in how biometric authentication works. The way biometrics are implemented are quite fluid and not at all tied 1:1 with your actual biological state. The data points collected from the client side is converted into hashes with matching keys to validate that the user is actually there at the time of access rather than doing something sci-fi and comparing 3D models and such (this would be unsafe to store and also very expensive to do). You see this also with Apple’s face ID and pretty much all finger print, face or otherwise authentication methods. These are some of the reasons we adopt these instead of pure password or certificate based authentication systems which let’s be honest, everyones parents or grandparents are storing on some hand written notes somewhere. So in short, you don’t need to change your face, you just change the hardware key and it’s good as new."

The price of day care  and the fact that my son was ready (he was actually digressing in day care/Pre School because he was bored), swayed our opinion.  Lacrosse was not even in our thoughts yet.    Now he is a full year+ younger than some of his teammates"

Plus they only want it U14 and below so they can still say ""look at all these commits we have. Give us your money now while Little Johnny is 7, and we will get him there."" Meanwhile, their older teams are all reclassed, and they will dump Little Johnny in a heart beat for kids all over the east coast in the final years to keep listing all those college commits."

1984qsp,law,UBTX22,"HB1 (requires 16+ age verification for social media websites) and this bill (requires 18+ age verification for adult websites) should be viewed as a package deal to try to make age verification on the internet commonplace (in spite of legal precedent and the first amendment clearly rejecting such age verification) rather than independently, the two bills were made HB1 and HB3 to indicate their priority and have thus far advanced together.  The quote included at the end of the article from speaker Paul Renner certainly is treating them as a together as he rails on ""social media and adult content websites""."
1984qsp,law,Da_Bullss,"""The bill (HB 3) would require any company that 'knowingly and  intentionally publishes or distributes material harmful to minors on a  website or application' to use 'reasonable age verification methods' to  prove that people accessing the site are at least 18 years old.""the biggest issue this bill face when it passes is how it defines the words it uses to get around the 1st amendment.(d) ""Material harmful to minors"" means any material that:The average person applying contemporary community standards would find, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;Depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct as specifically defined in s. 847.001(19)*;When taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.*847.001(19)(19) “Sexual  conduct” means actual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual  intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, or sadomasochistic abuse;  actual or simulated lewd exhibition of the genitals; actual physical  contact with a person’s clothed or unclothed genitals, pubic area,  buttocks, or, if such person is a female, breast with the intent to  arouse or gratify the sexual desire of either party; or any act or  conduct which constitutes sexual battery or simulates that sexual  battery is being or will be committed. A mother’s breastfeeding of her  baby does not under any circumstance constitute “sexual conduct.”I think (d)3 is where they will get the most resistance because its too vague to establish a standard web publishers can reasonably follow. what lacks serious literary, artistic or scientific value for minors changes drastically dependent on the age of the minor. Arguably even pornography provides scientific value for minors in the later teenage years, but you don't need to make that argument because the definition of sexual conduct is too broad.However, if i were fighting this bill, I would focus on federal preemption and the commerce clause to avoid the current supreme court from fucking with our first amendment freedoms."
1984qsp,law,UBTX22,"That harmful for minors definition is fairly standard across the states and has been for a long time, thanks to a combination of Ginsberg v. New York and Miller v. California.  This bill should be found unconstitutional (with Reno v. ACLU being the direct legal precedent with regards to such age verification), but it is unlikely that the definition of material harmful to minors will be the reason it gets found as such."
1hiw76d,law,ControlCAD,"Pornhub says it will block access to its website in Florida as an adult entertainment advocacy group sues over the state’s new law requiring age verification.HB-3, an act relating to online protections for minors, will go into effect in the Sunshine State on New Year’s Day, requiring adult websites to prevent children from accessing them.Mike Stabile, a public policy director with Free Speech Coalition, a group that advocates for the adult entertainment industry, says he is concerned about the steps that will be used to verify someone’s age.“When you’re uploading an ID or when you’re doing this type of verification, nothing is ever secure,” Stabile said.Free Speech Coalition is the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit seeking to prevent the law form taking effect over privacy and free speech concerns.“You are asking people who are legal adults to risk their privacy and risk possible surveillance to access the internet,” Stabile said.Since 2022, 19 states have passed laws requiring age verification to access adult websites.Ian Corby, the director of global group Age Verification Providers Association, pushed back, saying personal information will be protected.“The Florida law includes, explicitly, a requirement for anonymous age verification done by a third-party. Our entire industry was created to prove your age online and not have to disclose your identity,” Corby said.It’s a measure that was passed with overwhelmingly bipartisan support.“All we are trying to do is to make the same laws apply in the online world as applied in the real world,” Corby said.Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody is listed as the defendant in the case.“As a mother, and Florida’s Attorney General, I will fight aggressively in court to ensure the ability to protect Florida children,” Moody said.Aylo, Pornhub’s parent company, released a statement after vowing to block access to users statewide as a form of protest that read in part:“First, to be clear, Aylo has publicly supported age verification of users for years, but we believe that any law to this effect must preserve user safety and privacy, and must effectively protect children from accessing content intended for adults.”“Unfortunately, the way many jurisdictions worldwide, including Florida, have chosen to implement age verification is ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous. Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy. Moreover, as experience has demonstrated, unless properly enforced, users will simply access non-compliant sites or find other methods of evading these laws.”"

194uvqu,legaladviceofftopic,jeroen-79,Even if Pornhub took money from people in Utah I don’t see how Utah would have any jurisdiction against the website.Pornhub doing business with Utahians in Utah would be why Utah may assume jurisdiction over Pornhub.If Pornhub has no physical presence in Utah at all exercising that jurisdiction would rely on the assistance of other states or countries.If Utah issues Pornhub a fine and Pornhub is heaquartered in California then Utah could ask California to enforce the fine.Then California would have to decide if it prefers having good relations with Utah or the business Pornhub brings to the state.Pornhub may also decide that playing nice with states it is not in may benefit them in the future if things change and they want to do more business there.That may be easier if they have been trying to abide by their laws than if they have never respected any of these laws.
194uvqu,legaladviceofftopic,gnfnrf,"There is a broad and not entirely consistent set of case law about jurisdiction in case involving commerce over the Internet.But the prevailing test right now is the Zippo test, (from a case involving two companies named Zippo) which says that if you have a website with an ongoing and interactive relationship with customers, there is jurisdiction in the locale of those customers.  If your website simply offers information without creating a commercial or interactive relationship, there is not.So, extending that to online porn, those sites are trying to make money by selling premium accounts or making referrals to other sites that sell premium accounts.  It is certainly arguable that is an ongoing and interactive relationship under Zippo (though a purely advertising supported site is probably not, from other rulings, unless the advertising is targeted to the specific jurisdiction).An entirely free and non-commercial site that said ""here are pictures of naked ladies/men, have at it"" would probably not be in the same situation.But these things are complicated, and it is likely that the fear of an expensive court case is enough to have a chilling effect on businesses, even if they would prevail against the law in the end."

1fqp9ua,legaladviceofftopic,the_third_lebowski,"This is not the kind of law I handle, so my answer is kind of useless, but I do have some thoughts. They boil down to the idea that you could probably be prosecutedsomewherein America, and that due to the nature of the internet there's a real risk that some random state's laws will actually apply - at least as to the website and the customers.Knowing how laws are often written, I would expect at least one or more US states have a law about child abuse written broadly enough to apply. Whether that's under a theory of ""sexual abuse"" or ""child abuse"" that covers non-physical acts (for example, explicit lewd conversations with children, or telling a child that you will give them money for future sex acts). Think of it this way: do you expect that it's illegal (at least somewhere) to walk up to a eight year old and offer them candy now to have sex with you in ten years? Because if so, the law is probably not written in a way that distinguishes different ages of being below the age of consent. Itmaybe written in a way that relies on a subjective measure of ""causing emotional harm"" which might apply to differently aged children differently. But it might just discuss the idea of lewd subject matters being discussed for the purpose of sexual gratification. (Hell, these days you're at risk of some state passing a law against discussing sex with minors at all, even for the purpose of teaching biology! But going back to normal laws for the moment . . .)I believe, although I don't know for certain, that child pornography laws focus more on whether the purpose of the media is for the purpose of sexual gratification rather than whether it actually involves sex. That's why naked baby photos and national geographic stuff about tribal societies with different clothing norms aren't legally child porn. There is likely an argument that posting normal photos of a child on a website for the purpose of paying her money now to get her naked later fits into this legal scheme. At least under some state's law if not the federal law.I am basically certain that normal prostitution/sex work laws have provisions against children engaging in sex work - after all its obviously illegal to have child sex phone lines. It's likely that at least some of these laws will be written broadly enough to include planning and paying for future sex acts.It is fairly likely that at least one state has a law about grooming that is written broadly enough to apply, although to be fair I did a quick Google search and the few I found only discussed facilitating future illegal actions - not the idea of grooming minors to have sex upon turning 18. But that behavior is widely considered abusive and so I bet there's at least some law somewhere that covers it.Assuming for the moment one of these laws is written broadly enough to apply, there would then be a question of who to prosecute, who did what, etc. It depends on how the law is written, but I would expect such laws to get to actual intent, which can be proven regardless of what people pretend to say. I doubt it would help that a customer never talked to the child, they actively participated in paying the child (and therefore encouraging/participating/whatever legal term was used) to engage in this work now. Even if the most explicit acts are for the future. The child is possibly in violation as well. Prosecuting child sex acts against the children is tricky but it does happen. Usually more in the realm of actual child pornography and prostitution laws rather than in terms of broader  child abuse laws. So it depends what laws end up applying. The government would conceivably be incentivized to rely more on civil forfeiture than prosecution (taking away the money that the child earned through illegal conduct, for the purpose of disincentivizing additional children to follow suit).Finally, the website is almost certainly in trouble for allowing any of this to happen in the first place."

She lied about her age and did main stream porn for two years.Lords made the first of many porn movies in 1984, when she appeared in What Gets Me Hot! alongside Tom Byron, who later became her boyfriend off‑screen.[17] She first appeared only in a non-sexual role but was later replaced with a hardcore scene. In her next movie, Those Young Girls, she appeared in a sex role alongside Harry Reems and Ginger Lynn. After turning 16 and appearing with John Leslie (an actor 23 years her senior) in the porno parody Talk Dirty to Me Part III (which won the AVN Award for the best movie), Lords was hailed as the “Princess of Porn”.[9] She became one of the highest-paid porn actresses of that time, earning more than $1,000 a day. Besides her work in porn, she also appeared in the music video for “Gimme Gimme Good Lovin’” by the heavy metal band Helix. Lords continued making more movies until late 1984 when she tried to quit the industry at age 16, but returned a few months later. Just before her 17th birthday, she met Stuart Dell, who became her boyfriend, manager, and business partner - Dell used the pseudonym Steven (or Stephen) Cartier. Together they formed the Traci Lords Company. Dell and Lords made a distribution deal with Sy Adler, an industry veteran who ran Vantage International, in which they would produce three movies for the company. In March 1986, the first TLC feature was released; titled Traci Takes Tokyo, it was shot in Tokyo around Christmas Day 1985. The second, Beverly Hills Copulator, was released afterwards, but the third movie, Screamer, was shelved.[17][18] During late May 1986 (around three weeks after Lords’ 18th birthday), authorities were informed that she had been underage when she appeared in the porn movies. She had lied (according to Lords, it was a “white lie”) to law enforcement, photographers, producers, directors, co-workers, and the general public for two years. The owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. were arrested (see United States v. X-Citement Video, Inc.). She was taken into protective custody and hired high-profile lawyer Leslie Abramson. On July 10, district attorney’s investigators searched Lords’ Redondo Beach home as well as the Sun Valley offices of Vantage International Productions (a major producer of adult movies) and the Sherman Oaks offices of modeling agent Jim South. South and other industry officials said that Lords, who was seeking employment, provided a California driver’s license, a U.S. passport, and a birth certificate, which stated that her name was Kristie Nussman and gave a birth date of November 17, 1962. Leslie Jay, a spokeswoman for Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, also said Lords showed identification indicating that she was older than 18 before the illicit photos for the September 1984 issue were taken.[19] When investigators used Lords’ fake birth certificate and fake state identification cards to locate the real Kristie Nussman, Nussman said that her birth certificate had been stolen a few years earlier and that an impostor had apparently forged her name on official forms. Two adults who knew Lords, but who requested anonymity, said they saw her picture in the adult magazine Velvet during July 1984 and telephoned the district attorney’s office to inform authorities that she was underage, but that an investigator told them, “There isn’t anything we can do about it.”[20][21]"
1fqp9ua,legaladviceofftopic,Uhhh_what555476384,"I'm reposting it as a top level reply to original poster.One of the replies you recieved was about the way the internet is broadcast everywhere and how it's probably a crime somewhere.  So here it goes:""Knowing how laws are often written, I would expect at least one or more US states have a law about child abuse written broadly enough to apply. Whether that's under a theory of ""sexual abuse"" or ""child abuse"" that covers non-physical acts (for example, explicit lewd conversations with children, or telling a child that you will give them money for future sex acts).""I didn't even think about this and I'm a public defender in Washington State. This is a felony. Communication With a Minor for Immoral Puproses.https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.68A.090"
1fqp9ua,legaladviceofftopic,Awesomeuser90,"Contracts made by a minor can often be voided once they become an adult, if they give back the consideration they got. It might well not bind her to actually deliver it, if she disclaims the contract and returns the money. I don't know if this is especially helpful to answer this question but it is something I suppose."
1fqp9ua,legaladviceofftopic,rustys_shackled_ford,"Well can a minor enter Into a legal contract?Can the hurt parties prove that the offending party made a promise for something in exchange for money and then refused to make them whole or refund the money?not assumptions based on this or that. A legal case would need evidence that something was clearly advertised or promised that is now no longer being upheld.The ""court"" would look at alot of these things to make thier decision, and I'm sure it would be case by case.I'm sure theres a judge who would say, throw out every case because of the minor thing, and any reasonable adult should know better then to try and enter Into a legal contract with a minor. So the pervs got exactly what they deserved.If a judge decided they were willing to hear the facts beyond the minor thing, they would almost certainly want to see some proof that the person made certain promises and is now not willing to full fill said promises. Which, at worst would be a refund. This would probably look like a verified DM, message, or post that clearly states adult content to come one shes 18. And even then, what does adult mean here? A good lawyer would argue adult could range from racy pics to triple X content.The biggest head scratcher in your question is in your 'did the subscribers do anything wrong?'.... In that paragraph you make alot of assumptions the court simply wouldnt make.When something comes to court, it needs to be clearly defined. If 100 men started a sub because they were hoping for Bob's and vagins,  but that was never clearly stated, your looking at 100 idiots that have absolutely no case."

1iimsbg,LegalAdviceUK,Adorable_Trip6595,"It's pointless, people will just sail the high seas instead or use a VPN to bypass the checks."
1iimsbg,LegalAdviceUK,Sad-Yoghurt5196,"When the government insisted torrent sites and certain adult content had to be blocked by the major ISPs they also blocked a whole bunch of other stuff, like sites catering to the locksport community and genuine registered locksmiths. While not having any appreciable effects on users that used porn and pirate bay etc.Policy makers rarely have any real experience in the field in which they set policy. They're ""good idea"" people with zero knowledge of how to implement things in the real world, and even less idea of who to hire to do it competently.If porn is your thing, this is unlikely to affect you frankly. A monkey can work a browser proxy or VPN, so it won't be difficult to get around. There's no one authority on the internet, and even if all the western nations were to band together to insist on age verification I don't think Kiribati or the Christmas Islands will be giving a toss about it.

This left me on the sign-up sheet, which works just fine without age verification.

1amjpb7,linkedin,CodeBillGo,"I have been on LinkedIn for many many years and everything is fine until I verified myself by work email which also went through well this afternoon within one minute.Then this evening when I tried to logon to LinkedIn, I was told the account was restricted. Tried following their unblocking procedure and was redirected to Persona which made me feel unsafe.I googled a bit and came across this post. Looks like it's not only me who got restricted by LinkedIn.So I went ahead and uploaded my driver's license to Persona and agreed to share it with LinkedIn. Got an email to my personal email account with a case number.I'll report back how it goes."
1amjpb7,linkedin,Creeptoe_Mike,"Persona is sketchy as hell as a business.  It's run out of a coworking space in a sketchy SF neighborhood (Mission and 6th St., if you know), and there's literally zero information about the team or it's board on their website.  Ironic that a company dedicated to collecting highly sensitive personal information ostensibly for ""know your customer"" purposes doesn't have any interest in itself disclosing the people behind the company.  Maybe it's there, but not easy to find.   ""About Us"" section has zero info, just some nice puffy language about the company's goals and such.  Read the myriad ""privacy"" policies and disclosures and you will know exactly NOTHING about limitations and how data is kept.  There again, just lots of puffery, circular language and plentiful ""might"" and ""can include"" and ""primarily"" language that ultimately says nothing capable of reliance.  Oh, and the ""what we disclose"" section might as well say ""we will do with your data what we choose"" because the description covers such a wide range of ""instances"".HARD NO for me."

1clt22h,linkedin,Relevant-Pop-2595,"Same happened to my account about a month ago. Couple of days before that I've changed my psw, updated phone number and added MFA. Since then everything was working fine for few days, it felt good that my LinkedIn security got bit stronger. Then suddenly out of nowhere without any logical explanation my account became restricted and basically inaccessible. This directly impacted login steps which when logging in through web redirected me to the LinkedIn app where I was asked to verify my ID viaPersonaservice. Unfortunately bad luck in my case even after uploading 2 different IDs this service became stuck and continued to show this message for over a WEEK!After that I've started to seriously push both Persona and LinkedIn starting with Persona first through theirhelp centerand their onlysupport contactI found. Unfortunately Persona covered their ""ID data collecting"" back and finger pointed LinkedIn for this situation in classic blaming game and repeatedly stated to contact them first. However double bad luck was that LinkedIn doesn't allow to place support ticket under account which is currently restricted or inaccessible. Finally Persona gave me one more option to contact them through ""Data Subject Access Request"" (DSAR), however this option didn't help as well and their response was same as before to contact LinkedIn! By then I was really pi$$ed and started to knock really loud on LinkedIn & Microsoft ""heaven"" HELL doors""!As I've mentioned LinkedIn doesn't allow users to place ticket under account which is restricted/inaccessible, because in order to do that guess what?! - you need to be LOGGED IN! So you are basically stuck and left with only option to contact their support through other unrestricted/accessible account, which I had to register. However, even after creating support ticket under new account regarding restricted account they are unable to help and kept repeating - that it has to be done from account user is placing ticket. By then I was really, REALLY PI$$ED! and I've started to write messages to theirLinkedIn pageto immediately start solving my account restriction! Somehow I got lucky and person from LinkedIn support sent me psw reset link to restricted account email, which miraculously worked and I was finally able to access my account without Persona ID verification restriction. BTW, I've tried psw reset through login forgot psw option before that and it didn't work!Later on in conversation with LinkedIn support they mentioned there's a ""hidden"" way tocontactthem even with restricted/inaccessible account through thislink.Their representative also continued to explain possible reasons why accounts can become restricted/inaccessible and benefits of the verification badge:1. ID verification during account restriction:here are possible reasons why LinkedIn restricts an account. During an account restriction,we need to verify your identity to ensure that only you regain access to your account and not any unauthorized person.2. Verifications on your LinkedIn profile: A verification badge on your profile shows that you were able to confirm specific information about your account.The benefits can be explored in this link.All of that doesn't answer MAIN QUESTION - why in HELL! isn't LinkedIn under all mighty Microsoft able to verify and unblock users with active MFAand verified phones when their accounts become restricted/inaccessible and they are stuck by Persona ID verification which takes over week or more to complete?!Once again big tech corporations have shown that quality of their user support is on the bottom of their investment bucket list. They rather spend billions on something which will push their loyal users even further away from them. It can be worse (Meta), but also much better!Hope this will be helpful to somebody in similar situation."
1clt22h,linkedin,MilkAdCreative,"Welcome to the family. I've been trying on and off for 6 months through Persona and through Clear.

The reasons regarding combating misinformation and security ostensibly makes sense but is the standard excuses, just corporate boiler plate.. there's always a reason, and then a good reason, and the real reason. and the real reason here is data harvesting. And frankly LinkedIn is going to find itself in a position in which it ends up with a lawsuit at some point."
1clt22h,linkedin,Ok_Dot_2150,"I am in similar situation - my account is restricted temporarily. Did not get email about it, nothing. I suspect my account was blocked because I might have VPN on and was logging in, but I am guessing.To get it back Linkedin requires ID verification.I have 2mfa enabled. I have my email. I have both devices I used to login and same home network. I could even ask people who know me on Linkedin to confirm I am trying to login (something like Facebook has). I think ID verification like this is too much!Is Persona safe? Probably yes. I don't know them.Not sure what you will choose to do, but I will never upload my valid ID anywhere online!So right now I have my account closed and I don't think I will ever try to have another social media account with my real name on it :("
1clt22h,linkedin,Mr_Xano,"I feel you brother. I am sort of in a war against them. I am talking to them via email and twitter and they refuse to do anything or answer my questions about why i got the restriction unless i upload my id.I've never seen a social media requesting this kind of verification and the legality of this is something i have been questioning a lot lately.Funny, is that they only answer your DMs on Twitter if you publicly call them out.One thing i did was to film my facing holding a paper with my name and DMd that video to them on twitter. I even hurted my eyes because i used an old pair of glasses that i use in my Linkedin pfp. Lets see if they have enough brain cells to reason with this."

15jhma4,loveafterporn,el-unicornio,"literally DO NOT do this unless you are super prepared for what you’re going to find.we had a huge blowout discovery about a month ago where he put all these blockers on his phone and did this whole song and dance about not watching anymore.well he’s admitted to slipping up a couple of times in the past few weeks. whenever I asked what he was watching, he told me he couldn’t remember and didn’t think about it too much.since I found out he was still using, he’s been incredibly cold and distant. never having time to talk to me or interact with me. Thursday night i installed a tracker on the computer while he was sleeping. Friday as I was walking into work (7:14 in the morning), I got an alert and a screenshot that he was watching “trans traps” on a discord server.I never really knew what he was into before but having the proof at the exact time it was happening really shook me to my core and i can’t get any of the images out of my head.so, be safe and please only take these types of measures if you’re actually prepared for what you might uncover."
15jhma4,loveafterporn,[deleted],This isn’t necessarily to track so to speak…it’s a blocker. It prevents him from viewing things and getting pop ups (over the phone) that would trigger him back into his old ways while he actively makes an effort to change 🤷🏻‍♀️ But I totally understand what you’re saying and that would be awful.
15jhma4,loveafterporn,[deleted],"Curious , does this allow you to check their phone from your own phone? And if so, will it send that two factor authentication? Thanks!"
1gwry0y,LowStakesConspiracies,VFiddly,"Previous UK governments have tried to ban certain parts of the internet and it has never actually worked. I expect if they even get that far, it won't work. Most likely all it would actually do is require social media sites to ask for your ages like porn sites do. They don't actually check.In any case, if you have a photo ID, the government already has your name, face, and date of birth, so this wouldn't tell them anything they don't already know."
1gwry0y,LowStakesConspiracies,Hellonstrikers,They could be used to track internet habits.
1gwry0y,LowStakesConspiracies,wrighty2009,"The teens will just use free vpn plans or otherwise find ways around it. All it'll do is push kids social media usage into the underground, making them even less safe online. The schools and people who did educate their kids about social media and being safe online think they won't have to do it as their kids can't access social media anymore, and the social media will be overrun with teens who havent been told that Instagram isn't real, and that there's predators pretending to be 14, and that Russian bots try to destabilise other countries democracy.Sure, some clever parents will still educate about the risks of social media, but similar to my in laws family who thought their 14 year old wasn't going to get smashed at a news years party as ""she's 14,"" others who usually would educate their kids, will not bother telling them a fucking thing."
1gwry0y,LowStakesConspiracies,TheMissingThink,"Governments have been trying to regulate internet access almost since it first appeared.  Even China's 'great firewall' has proved ineffective.Child safety is just the wedge that's currently being used to drive the legislation - after all, who doesn't want to protect children?Of course, the children will be among the first to bypass any safety measures that are brought in. The solution is to push responsibility back onto the parents. Most parents these days grew up with the internet,  so ignorance is not an excuse."
1gwry0y,LowStakesConspiracies,Katwazere,Early unsupervised Internet access has caused severe psychological issues in the young generations. Also governments already have access to all that data
1gwry0y,LowStakesConspiracies,Spiderinthecornerr,"Gov yes, these companies, no"
1gwry0y,LowStakesConspiracies,IAmTaka_VG,"I used to think this. But I’m at the point where it’s impossible to stop your kids from using social media.Despite, talks, bans, parental controls, restrictions. Even the “main” social media apps are so dangerous and bad for their wellbeing.Social media IMO should require age verification if you have over X million users.Keep forums and small chats private but tiktok, meta, and shit need to be regulated or down right banned for people under 16."
1gwry0y,LowStakesConspiracies,AdvancedSandwiches,Older people don't seem to be doing any better with it.  Just ban all ages. None of us are better off with this shit.
1gwry0y,LowStakesConspiracies,Freecelebritypics,ngl they should ban social media for everyone. It has no value

bif90k,MaliciousCompliance,RexMcRider,"""Not getting the imprint can lead to termination if there were enough offenses so I really don’t typically like risking that.""DEFINETLY.  I spent about 10 years working in Merchant Services on the Merchant side.  The amount of charge backs that can get an account closed only has to reach 1% or 2 %.  And the worst part:  Once that happens, the business, AND the ""business principals"" that signed the application, all get put on the Terminated Merchants File (we used to call it ""Getting TMFd"").  Once a business &/or person has been TMFd, they can't get another merchant account in the US.  Period, end of subject.  You can get taken off of it, but it's a bitch.  That said, pretty much everyone I ever heard about getting TMFd was a crook (and usually not to bright either).So, if you have a business that has goofed but you're on good terms, try and make it right with them another way.If they're hosing you, then charge that sucker back!"

It was always “We’re the party of small government” but now they’re coming with “Well I’m not advocating for big government, I just believe in government intervention when necessary” type arguments lol"
18ra1ur,MarkMyWords,[deleted],More likely is that we're about to learn how many Republicans have a thing for tranny porn.
18ra1ur,MarkMyWords,Dr-Satan-PhD,"Ex post facto,per the US Constitution (Article I, Section 9, Clause 3). You cannot be prosecuted for something that was legal at the time you did it. They would have to amend or get rid of the Constitution in order to do so.Now, if you want to get into that conversation,Trump has explicitly saidhe would be willing to terminate ""all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution"", over his claims of election fraud. So it wouldn't be a stretch for him (or some other autocratic fuckhead) to attempt to terminate the Constitution over porn. Speaker Mike Johnson would be the one to look out for on this topic.In order to amend the Constitution, you need to either a) have two thirds of both the House and Senate vote for the proposal, or b) you need two thirds of the state legislatures to call a Constitutional convention, something that has happened exactly one time in US history, where the Constitution itself was drafted. All other amendments have been passed via option a. To completely abandon the Constitution, we would need to already be an all-out fascist dictatorship, and at that point, accessing porn is going to be the least of your worries."
18ra1ur,MarkMyWords,ConflagWex,They don't have to prosecute people for viewing pr0n when it was still legal.  They'd have a list of people they know are into that and try to catch them with contraband materials after they make it illegal.  Or at the very least harass the hell out of people on the list to discourage it.
18ra1ur,MarkMyWords,Aesirtrade,"Good news is data shows such content is  iewed more often by Republicans than Democrats. So when they start hitting people with felonies, for the actual purpose of eliminating voters, they'll hurt themselves more than others.They know they watch porn all the time, and they are not capable of imagining people are different or better than them, so Dems must be worse. They figure they'll knock out a 2-1 ratio of dems to reps. It'll likely be the reverse."

oysben,MawInstallation,The-Last-Despot,Amazing read. It makes so much sense and kind of shows why r2 was always instantly able to break into enemy networks. Also makes sense as to why assets were put in physically defensible locations. It definitely makes for more interesting warfare in my opinion! The only thing we are missing is an example of guided ordinance being hacked.

oysben,MawInstallation,spineflu,"Droids are memory wiped frequently because they WILL divulge all of their secrets if captured. They can't help it, though an Organic might resist torture, but a Droid can simply be sliced.depending on their models of cognition and assuming a sophisticated enough micro-robotics interface, the organic beings could also be hacked to divulge their secrets without torture, should this be trueIt's unclear whether Star Wars doesn't have appropriate micro-robotic circuitry to make the brain interface, or whether the research required to map the physiology of all sentient species is untenable, but assuming one could solve the chemical computer of the brain, organic beings brains would be just as hackable, with a much more annoying physical interface.(also you've got your P and NP mixed up about midway through - NP has the verification algos, P has the solution algos.)"
oysben,MawInstallation,sroomek,The Techno Union did this to Echo. They were able to pull the Republic battle strategy data directly out of his mind via the cybernetics they installed in his head.
oysben,MawInstallation,Ricky_Boby,"To add to your theory it's probable that the Star Wars universe has Quantum Computers, which aretheorized to be able to break our current encryption methods with ease. Here MIT thinks it would only take 8 hours to break a 2048 bit RSA key in the next 25 years. To compare that key would take up to300 trillion years to brute force with a traditional computer.Moreover, encryption algorithms in general and asymmetric encryption in particular are hard to find and do right. Currently we only know of RSA (which dates to 1978) and ECC (which dates to 1985) as provably secure asymmetric encryption algorithms. If advancements are not made in Quantum Encryption we may be in the same boat as your theory, where airgaps (not connecting your device/local network to the internet) are the only solution, and honestly I work in Industrial Controls and most factories and critical machines are already airgaped as it is since that is the only 100% security available."
1gff9z5,mcytsnark,miffyolo,"Ranboo’s operating under a lot of flawed assumptions with the VTuber bans—a lot of them are being banned for purposefully being suggestive in ways that other VTubers have noted as being fair, and also applies to IRL streamers. VTubers just have a habit of pretending otherwise for twitter.I’m sure it’s a part of the ‘child star’ phenomenon and trying to force themselves into being seen as mature and shedding their old content. They just haven’t actually put in the work to make that happen. Their humor remains the same, their content is basically the same, and their fanbase is just DSMPers who stuck around.There’s been no evolving, similar to others in the space like TommyInnit, so trying to force it will endlessly come of as both uncanny and entitled."
1gff9z5,mcytsnark,[deleted],the most i've seen is ppl pointing out the weird double standard's with twitch since they allow waaaay to many things on their platform but considering ranboo's audience of chronically online tumblr kids they'll fall for it

1gff9z5,mcytsnark,AccomplishedToday493,"Honestly if Ranboo want's to start appealing to the 18+ crowd, he has to be careful as like mentioned before some of their fans are minors (bc lets be honest who the hell gonna be in their 20's and actually watch this trash)"

IRL streamers who play up the suggestive content are also getting banned for not following these rules—which I believe is showing thighs/hips uncovered, show casing clothed body in a sexualized way, and the like.It definitely sucks for the VTubers who actuallyaren’tbreaking the TOS, but for every 5 who aren’t, they are 5 that are.My only suggestion is that if you want more suggestive content, an 18+ Patreon or an OnlyFans is most definitely available!"

1azwy7q,Mercari,Environmental-Sock52,If you get an ID yes.
1azwy7q,Mercari,Ccdynamite23,"Are you under age? I’m guessing that’s why you don’t have any sort of ID. Most people 18 and up have something, driver license, state ID, passport, military ID, etc. if you are under age, you are screwed. You won’t get that money because you have to be over 18 to sell on Mercari & have ID to make the deposits & get tax info sent to you"
1azwy7q,Mercari,ShitpostCentral423,"Posts like this are why I hate that Reddit is flooded with children now. It’s policy… not some conspiracy, and if you’re under 18 why are you selling to begin with?"

1azwy7q,Mercari,Longjumping-Chef-936,If you don't have the money to get a temporary driver's license (not every state has them but in mine you can get at 16 years old and you have to take a test on the bmv computers) you can see if your state has free state ID's. It's not a driver's license but it is a good alternative if you don't drive. I think in Ohio they're issued for either 5 to 10 years or 4 to 8 years. It's been a minute since I looked at the website.

1j9pffv,Mercari,dontdownvotemethx,"Yeahhh literally what happened to me.

1hv4l4f,MetaQuestVR,W00lph,If he's under 13 and you set him up as 13+ then it's a problem. If you use his ID then he should not be on 13+ account. If you use your ID and they decide someone under 13 is using your account can get account banned.
1hv4l4f,MetaQuestVR,Flaming_F,"It's legit and there is also a possibility of a spoof and scam. So don't click any link in this emailBest advice would be to go directly on meta.com website , log into your account, then go in your personal informations and update/Confirm your birthdate there ."
1hv4l4f,MetaQuestVR,popticle,He doesn’t play any online games but does play some age restricted games.Thanks all. I’m just unsure how to verify.
1hv4l4f,MetaQuestVR,Tikcash,"I don’t understand, if your son is 11 then if you verify it it’ll still be under 13, and if you use your own do the names match? I’m assuming you used your sons name for the sub account"
1hv4l4f,MetaQuestVR,popticle,"Yeah they won’t match, I just wasn’t sure if there was a workaround. I can set up a new account for him or set one up for me and he uses that, but is there any way to share the games ? Or are they now lost. They’re within the 14 days but I think he’s played over 2 hours of them"
1hv4l4f,MetaQuestVR,SJLJOSH,That happened to me once I just had to use a credit card and tada
1hv4l4f,MetaQuestVR,TedRuxpin,I believe the issue is Roblox normally - if a child's account logs into Roblox associated with a Quest this is triggered if the ages don't match (Roblox child on an adult Meta account) at least that's what I've noticed a few times.
1hv4l4f,MetaQuestVR,SuperbSmuffette420,They actually asked me to pay $1.00 for a kid to use and play VR. No one should pay for a dollar for a kid to use it. Unacceptable of Meta.
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,PsychologicalCat6537,"I mean, during the checkout you go through the whole process of putting your account number and transfer pin so I don’t see how anyone would think the port would not happen immediately…."
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,Cashyonutz,This sounds so fake…
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,Ethrem,Yet it's a story that's been repeated multiple times about Metro. Even people signing up on the website found their phone number was ported instantly and they were left with no service.
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,Lunna9279,for porting i highly recommend doing it in store if the port doesn’t go through we can see it in real time and fix it reps on the phone dont care they wont have to deal with you again so they want to be quick
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,BusinessAd851,Bro are u ok? How did you think you’d still have service with cricket when you are creating a new account n everything with metro and having a phone shipped to you without cricket releasing your number 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,MilkWithCookies_,"That sucks. Prepaid carriers like Metro and Cricket unfortunately don't give temporary numbers for scenarios like this. The best thing to do if you do everything online, especially porting over, is to give the wrong account number or transfer pin. That way the transaction goes through, but you won't be out of service, and when you get your phone, you can call or go to a store to help correct the information"
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,ExcellentGur4669,"I've been a Metro T-Mobile customer for 10 months now and I really like the prices and the service.They definitely have the best plans for the best price nowadays.But I would definitely suggest that you do everything online and you'll actually save a little money that way too.Ive had some employees be somewhat rude to me and they seem a little annoyed by dealing with a flesh and blood customer.I even got charged a fee for paying in store with cash,lol,but it's great prices for great service, and even though the plan allows me to upgrade every 12 months I went in there the other day and upgraded after 10 months and had no problem doing it the employee was totally cool with it it only cost me $35 and I upgraded from the 2023 Moto g to the 2025 so I really can't complain but shave yourself the frustration and a little money and do everything online"
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,AdAppropriate8772,"I wish to f$&# I was making all this up and the woman in the store being rude blew my damn mind so I get why you might think it's BS but it happened and it made me feel like shit.As far as people saying I should have known  that my number would be imported right then, I definitely suspected it was and that's why I repeatedly told the guy that I didn't want to move the number that day because I didn't want to experience a loss of service. I must have said it seven or eight times and every time I mentioned it, the guy assured me that I was not going to lose service and the switch wouldn't happen until I got the new phone in my hand and activated it."
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,AwayPoem7090,Oof and here i was considering switching to metro
1jwcxvo,MetroPCS,Prior_Ad5495,Hi I have been with Metro PCS which is now Metro T-Mobile for 15 years. I have never had a problem with them every time I go in the store they are so courteous and helpful I couldn't ask for better service. I'm sorry that this happened to you. I'm sure you know that if you don't get your phone you just call your credit card company and dispute the entire thing and they will remove it from your account you won't have to pay for this if you don't get your phone. But it's very aggravating to have that happen to you. But like I said I've been with Metro for ages and their service is great and I've never had a problem with areas any place around the United States that I go there's service

1fjyubh,Monopoly_GO,neopod,Just wondering how many folks used their actual age too?
wtan2k,MUD,DarqueHorse,"We don't do age verification on Sundering Shadows but we make a clear statement that it's an adult game and under 18 is not allowed. That said, if someone decides to enter anyways, it's on them.We also do not mechanically allow child characters to be made. The lowest age for a character in game is 18 (unless it's an elf and then it's like 100). We also do not allow descriptions that in any way suggest the character is a child.Unless you're a monetized game, I don't see that population is super important. It's far better to play with people who share your gaming values."
wtan2k,MUD,[deleted],Thank you for the thoughtful response.
wtan2k,MUD,TedCruzIsAPedo,"Do what you need to do to give yourself peace of mind.Personally, I would be more inclined to hand my ID to a third-party identification system, rather than directly to a MUD admin. Services offered by sites like AgeChecker usually cost $20-30 month at the minimum. WithPersona offers a starter-level service for 500 checks/month free, which might be worth looking into, but I don't have experience with personally.It's important to feel good about the game you're running and the community you're trying to cultivate. If I was in your position I'd likely make similar considerations."
wtan2k,MUD,[deleted],"Yes, absolutely. I would never implement my own age verification system -- there are well-established (trusted) vendors available at affordable rates."
wtan2k,MUD,[deleted],I've been looking at Veriff -- but I'm not yet familiar with the available products/services.
wtan2k,MUD,Walmart_HeadReciever,The last thing I would want to do is give a mud anymore personal information.Probably easier to just monitor how mature someone acts.
wtan2k,MUD,FluffyCasual,"What do you mean by ""verification""?If you want to set a rule, that's pretty normal, and you can enforce it by banning people who admit to having broken it, but unless you're both collecting personal information and verifying that the people sending it to you aren't using some other person's name, I'm not sure how this is expected to catch the people who just lie. Faking a social media presence isn't at all hard, either.I think I recall some NSFW game asking for photos of government-issued ID, but that sets off some alarms in my head."
wtan2k,MUD,[deleted],"In terms of games -- age verification is most common in onlinegambling(due to legal requirements). But there's a growing movement to help protect children online with mitigating factors like age verification. Roblox has introduced this requirement for some features, such as voice chat.No system is 100% effective, but it's a question (to myself) of whether or not I'm doing my due diligence. Especially with something like an anonymous roleplaying environment with adult themes.If you want to join a public library or enter a bar, you often have to provide government-issued ID. I'm heavily leaning toward extending that norm to the Internet."
wtan2k,MUD,shevy-java,"I don't think it would add a huge burden in regards to limiting players (since you exclude e. g. minors).Personally, though, I don't think I would want to go through any hoops for having to verify my age. This is less about having an issue with it per se (I guess I can convincingly demonstrate that I am above 18 years of age), but more to do with being incredibly lazy. For instance, I absolutely hate captchas. Every time it feels as if it is done to just waste my time. I often am incorrect in regards to captchas.In regards to age verification: I actually started to play MUDs at age 15. If there would have been an age gate then I don't think I would have ever started simply because my interests shifted quickly past age 18. And time constraints became more prevalent. So I don't know ... I can kind of understand the rationale but I am not sure I agree with it."
wtan2k,MUD,the_andruid,"I think if you're upfront about why you're asking players to go through the check, making it as easy as possible, and using a trusted vendor, you'll have folks who are on board.You could have something like a 1 week grace period so that players have a chance to try the game out and decide whether they like it first. If you use a service that charges per accepted verification, you'll also save some money that way.Either way, peace of mind is hugely important for someone in an admin/staffer position and can help prevent burnout. If you think it'll help, I say give it a try. If it doesn't work out, you can always change it later."
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,diannethegeek,"""We proactively made staffing changes"" No, their entire staff walked out in April. If they fired anyone, they took desperate measures to hide it, letting Faulkner step out gracefully on his own terms and hiding the staff page once people started to ask why others were missing."

1fvbegu,nanowrimo,Routine_Pumpkin8438,Is it just me or did this feel weirdly condescending/ blaming the community?
1fvbegu,nanowrimo,FieryArtemis,That’s how I felt too. Maybe they did get some truly vitriol that could be classified as harassment and bullying but it couldn’t have been the community as a whole.

1fvbegu,nanowrimo,bioticspacewizard,"""Our comments last month were prompted by intense harassment and bullying we were seeing on our social media channels, which specifically involved AI. When our spaces become overwhelmed with issues that don’t relate to our core offering, and that are venomous in tone, our ability to cheer on writers is seriously derailed.""I genuinely don't think that NaNoWriMo understands what harassment and bullying are. They keep using this in defense of their actions, but all I've seen are people raising genuine concerns and them being swept aside as ""vitriol.""Literally, all of this could have been avoided by making a clear, open, and public channel of communication with the community."

18u2q10,nationalparks,[deleted],"I’ve camped at Cades Cove and Elkmont and they never asked for an ID. A while back I camped at Cosby Campground and you just pay an honor box. Not sure if it’s still that way or not. The rangers are usually pretty chill, you can even camp before checking in if it’s later in the afternoon, just check in the next morning. All they give you is a piece of paper that says when you’re leaving so they know to check/clean up your site if needed."

1hvhbok,news,GayGeekInLeather,SCOTUS is already ruling on it this term. Lawsuit against the bill in Texas .
1hvhbok,news,IHeartBadCode,"For those wondering, Tennessee's law is different than all the rest of them.  Tennessee is attempting to make it a criminal offense rather than the Government trying to regulate a business.It's this idea that you can toss people into jail for distribution of porn that's got a lot of the federal court system in a tizzy.  If Tennessee was only attempting a Texas ban we'd have a different story.But Tennessee is trying to take the whole porn thing to a new level and there's not many who believe the federal justice system is going to let criminalizing the whole thing stand.Like it's one thing if they were just trying to regulate business, but the notion of tossing people in jail I know that's not going to sit well with Roberts and Kavanaugh, these two are usually anti-new criminal law.Kavanaugh especially as he's got quite the list of opinions he's signed onto that try to limit everyone's attempts to limit free speech.Moody v NetChoice LLC (2024)NRA v Vullo (2024)Lindke v Freed (2024)Counterman v. Colorado (2023) - This one especiallyI mean he even signed on to Ashcroft v ACLU for the ACLU in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, indicating that COPA (the Child Online Protection Act) was likely a substantial over-breadth that violated the first amendment.So even if this makes it to SCOTUS, the current composition of SCOTUS does NOT assure this to be the slam dunk that some think it will be.  The current Justices are really hesitant to grant anyone brand new criminality power.  Kavanaugh signed on to the denial of Texas' abortion travel ban.  He was not cool with Texas getting a brand new criminal power.The Justices don't seem to have problems with allowing States brand new regulatory power over businesses, but brand new criminality like Tennessee's law attempts is perhaps a line too far for the majority to cross.  This may be their limit on how much they'll bend over for conservatives.But it is important that everyone notes that Tennessee's law is very different than the other ones that have come out from other states."
1hvhbok,news,rainbowgeoff,Great write up. Only thing I'd add is that the threat of criminal sanction would solve any potential standing issue.
1hvhbok,news,Metalgrowler,People realize that this will be ultimately be used to get rid of any anonymity on the internet right?

1hvhbok,news,kandoras,"The judge also said the impact could be overly broad, potentially affecting other plaintiffs such as an online educational platform focused on sexual wellness.I'm pretty sure that was the actual point of the law.  Conservatives define the basic existence of LGBT people to be sexual, so this law was just another step towards erasing them by making it illegal for a website to mention them without first checking a viewer's driver's license."

1j8r6pu,NewToReddit,Lonelysenior60,So do you have to guess which website and verify with each website or What.  It seems like it just happened.  Wow very confusing.Thxs for your input
1j8r6pu,NewToReddit,PitchReasonable28,thnxs bro
1cyeujd,NewTubers,AudibleNoodles,I was able to do the video verification when I tried to add a “related video” to one of my shorts. It will send a link to your email which will send you to a page with instructions where you record a video of your face.
1cyeujd,NewTubers,OCDcentral,Thank you so much for your comment. I'm trying to figure out how to do just that. So far I could not find how to do it.
1cyeujd,NewTubers,Jiggle-BellyGaming,"Google already has more info on you than you could imagine, your ID isn't some big PII threat in comparison"
1cyeujd,NewTubers,OCDcentral,"I was waiting for a comment like that but I don't really disagree with you. I just don't feel like potentially giving them something they might not have. Trust me, a part of me ridicules myself for even saying that because they probably have EVERYTHING but I just really don't feel like uploading this ID."
1cyeujd,NewTubers,DaddyMoshe,"I’d say you’re overly paranoid. But that’s your choice, and my opinion. I mean, you use all of google’s free services daily already, so all of your information is theirs anyway. I’d rather youtube (google) have my ID than all my data l have on my phones, computer, drives, anything else. It’s the price you pay though, for “free” service"
1cyeujd,NewTubers,OCDcentral,"Just like I didn't dispute what the other person said, I'm not disputing what you're saying. Just feels crazy to give them this as well."
1cyeujd,NewTubers,JASHIKO_,"If you're planning on being monetised you will need to hand over a lot more information as well. Tax info, ID, address, bank details, etc. So if that's you're goal there's no avoiding giving up the data."
1cyeujd,NewTubers,Carter_Azathoth,I’m an overly paranoid person as well so I get it but I did it and I’ve had no issues. I looked at it more as if a job was request an ID since you’ll need to give them even more personal info to earn money from your videos.
1cyeujd,NewTubers,MichaelGoosebumpsfan,"People should be more angry about this, and I would absolutely never recommend doing it. There’s no reason for them to know who you are, and if anyone in this comments section tells you otherwise, they’re dumb and part of the problem."

1gwvkan,NewTubers,Eklipse-gg,"Ugh, Youtube's age verification stuff can be a pain.  Usually, it involves uploading a photo ID, but sometimes they want more.  Best bet is to check their help pages or support – they should have specific steps listed for appealing/proving your age.  Good luck getting it sorted!"

1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,sieraparagon,"Just wanted to express how much I love Citizen Sleeper. It was a 3-day binge for me during Christmas holidays and it filled me with hope and love, even if at times they were intertwined with sadness and grief.I was curious about a specific design dynamic. In the first game, at a certain point the player could snowball their dice rolls, as well as eliminate any of the early game threats which provided so much of the initial sense of pressure, anxiety and ""scrapping by"" feel. In my first playthrough, by the time I reached the Refugee Ships DLCs, none of the time-gated checks felt immediate or high-stakes, because I could so easily complete them.Is there a system to balance for that in Citizen Sleeper 2?"
1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,Jumpovertheage,"Hi! Yes, there 100% is. In fact there are multiple ways in which the sequel differs in this regard.First of all the contract structure means you go on high-intensity jobs, and then have downtime at hubs after, this means the game goes from tense/difficult, to calm and back again with a more regular pace.Then, when you are on contracts, there are many ways to succeed or fail: There are optional resources to gather, there is the possibility of limiting the damage you take, and there is the speed at which you complete the contract, as well as the overall pass/fail stakes of the contract. So ""success"" is more of a wide range of outcomes, that in some cases will relate to the players goals. So skilled players can aim for more than just scraping by.Upgrades are also different now, and focus on ""active"" rather than ""passive"" upgrades, where you build out your ""push"" ability and configure it for your playstyle. The push ability differs between classes, and has a strong tactical element, where you trade stress for a boost to you or your crews dice. It can be very powerful if yused effectively, but also a hindrance if not!Finally the game has variable difficulty settings, the base difficulty of which is harder than CS 1 (as there is a SAFE option for narrative focused players). Strong players who pursue every drive will still be able to become powerful through knowledge and upgrades, but its not an inevitability and the game is much more consistently higher pressure than the first one!"
1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,mareek,"Hi Gareth, I love Citizen Sleeper 1 and I describe it as the best cyberpunk novel I've ever read. The characters, the station, the universe... everything is perfect.My question is the following : Have you ever considered writing novels instead of/in addition to creating video games ?"
1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,Jumpovertheage,"I answered this one up above:https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1icvl5h/comment/m9u2zqu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_buttonBut I would also say that I love game design, and games, and I think I enjoy having people read in games, more than reading outside them. There's so many things you can do with game storytelling, and I love the way it invites/implicates the player in the story! I don't know if novels would satisfy my interest in that."
1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,anhedonis539,"Hi Gareth! Could you speak to your inspiration for the dice mechanics - specifically, how they’re rolled at the start of each cycle? As someone living with depression, it really spoke to the idea of never being 100% certain what you’d be able to do/ what you would have energy for in the future, and having to just take things one day at a time. Or maybe it truly was just a reworked TTRPG mechanic and I’m imposing my own experiences onto it 😂best of luck with the launch this week!!"
1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,Jumpovertheage,"Oh it certainly was inspired by my own struggles with depression and the feeling of waking up and having very little energy to face the day, but knowing I had to. I'm glad that aspect of it came through. It was also influenced by the tabletop game Blades in the Dark, and the dice/board game Pandemic: The Cure, but I'd say that mostly I was looking for a way to represent how I felt back when I was working random gig work, struggling with depression and barely meeting rent. Dice just ended up being the most effective way to do that!"
1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,DragonHorcrux,"Hi Gareth! Citizen Sleeper has quickly grown to become one of my all-time favorite games, it especially excited me when I realized you took inspiration from The Mushroom at the End of the World, which I was reading at the time of playing your game!I want to ask: How do you translate that dense theoretical research into informing your writing and game design, is there a specific process behind it for you or does it happen organically?Much love and good luck with the launch!"
1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,Jumpovertheage,"Thanks so much, its very cool that you were reading Tsing's book while playing!I'd say that the way I use research is as a way of creating a kind of mulch or compost for the game to grow from (if you will pardon the plant metaphor). I tend to try to take in as much about a subject that I can, following my curiosity. I especially spend time with texts or media that feel like they ""rhyme"" with my ideas, where I feel there's something that connects them to me, or some of the things I plan to explore. But then, once I have read them, I let them inform my work more organically, rather than go back to them or reference them. I always likes the Francis Bacon quote where he described himself as a ""pulverizing machine"" which process everything he looks at or feels, and uses that as raw material for his work. That's my process really, a broad and obsessive research phase that then feeds my own organic process of building ideas into the games!"
1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,TofrPilgrim,"Thank you for creatint this wonderful universe. It's so refreshing to play something dystopian yet hopeful. While the art by Guillaume and the music by Amos are phenonenal, it's the writing that sees me keep on coming back to the CS universe (still eagerly awaiting my Lost in Cult package 😅). Where did you get such awareness on the human psyche, and on the reverberations of small actions that create such far-fetching consequences?Thank you once again. Your games give me hope when the world feels darker. They encourage us to keep looking up, and to give that trust to someone."
1icvl5h,NintendoSwitch,Jumpovertheage,"Ah, thank you so much, I don't know if i can answer such a complimentary question! I guess I am very curious about people and have spent a lot of time in different jobs and contexts, so I feel like I have learnt about a lot of different ways of being a person. Empathy and curiosity are the greatest tools for a writer. Meanwhile, on plotting, I usually just work on instinct and feeling, so I guess my stories often grow out of small human-scale moments into bigger shifts. It's a kind of story I really enjoy to read myself :)"
qew9f0,nordvpn,rational_centaurus,"I think it depends on where you've created your account and the age on the account, VPN cannot bypass age restrictions"

1dnoi22,nycgaybros,Chance-Two4210,Yeah you’re right I checked today and it’s not there. I thought this was related to some recent laws passed by Hochul related to social media.My bad was just concerned.
1dnoi22,nycgaybros,[deleted],"In California you can look at Sniffies without even logging in or having an account at all. Is it different in other states? I'm not sure how they can enforce this.

49zeh5,OasisVape,[deleted],"I see that your employees see and verify the information.  How are employees vetted?Sorry,  but I will never order using this method.  I haven't placed an Oasis order since this started and never will again.  If this becomes industry standard I would DIY or go back to buying from a B&M.I do not trust random employees handling my DOB,  full name and last four digits of my SS number."
49zeh5,OasisVape,Giraffesarecool123,"If you don't understand that asking me to hand out my SSN just so I can buy ten dollars of e juice is a bad business practice, you can go fuck yourself"

49zeh5,OasisVape,KiteinCloud,"Question from a vendor here!To comply with Texas law, we utilize EVS which ties into the nationally recognized identity check systems (like LexisNexis). Around 75% of the time we get age verification just from the customer's name and billing address. For the remaining 25% that don't verify, simply asking for the customer's date of birth / confirming their billing address allows us to verify. There is a small fraction that do not show up in the system, and that is usually due to the billing address not being up to date.So I guess my question is, why should I go with your solution? Sell me! :)"
49zeh5,OasisVape,mflbninja,"Your ""frictionless"" process is costing mtbakervapor.com this customer."
49zeh5,OasisVape,MichiganCur,"I agree.   I decided to play the game and give it a shot.   Doesn't seem like it's going to be a ""one time process"" I received my good to go email, purchased then received a more information needed email.   Problem is the email doesn't state what's needed or how to get it to them.   So I replied to the email and they replied saying it was an email saying it was a reminder that more was needed.   Again not saying what was needed.   Now I get an email that says I couldn't be verified.   How's that when they already verified me for a purchase??  At least I already got my Mt Baker vapor purchase...  Sadly might be my last"
49zeh5,OasisVape,BlueCheckHelp,"How long have you been business? (As in officially operating?)October 2014, as a Delaware C-CorpHow long have you been providing age verification to the vaping industry?Specific to the vaping industry, about 4 months.  We learned about as the Texas legislation was coming to light, and decided to test the waters.  However, we have been doing identity verification (age as a component of identity) since we started.What is your favorite Will Smith movie?Absolutely love I am Legend – not sure if I like the alternative ending better than the original tho.Do you have a privacy policy? If you do have one, why has it not been publicly displayed?Privacy policy is attached – we are also just about to finish a new privacy policy and TOS specific for this use case, and that will be displayed as a checkbox on the popup that is mandatory for all users.We have been shuffling things around on our website (which is why the documentation is outdated as well) and haven’t had it back up.  I don’t differ with you that it needs to be displayed, and that was not presented well on our end.We’ll be adding it back on our website and to the popup ASAP.Who has access to the information? Who is verifying those that send in photos of them with their ID?BlueCheck employees have access to the information – we manually verify the photos sent in by hand.  No one else has access to the information – even Oasis doesn’t have access to it.  All we pass along is the time of verification, and whether it was a success or not.Why do you require the last four of SSN when others do not?This has been a question that has plagued me for a while! The original goal of BlueCheck was a simple way to verify that the person you were interacting with online was who they said they were.  So the question becomes: What is the easiest, most frictionless way, to verify an identity?I’ve looked at everything from photo recognition to social media mapping to voice verification/biometrics (Dragon API).  Everything always came back with some sort of hitch – either there was hardware required, or it wasn’t a ~100% match on a person, ie: people can create multiple social media profiles, to do biometrics you need a phone or webcam.We always came back to SSN – however as the outcry noted, it’s a big ask!  But it’s the easiest and fastest way to verify identity.The issue, on the other end of the spectrum, is that some people (fin-tech, etc) feel that SSN isn’t valuable enough anymore.  That there have been too many breaches.  So for now, we feel comfortable drawing our line in the sand at SSN (it’s only last 4 btw) and doing extra validation on those we can’t automatically verify.Edit: didn’t answer why others don’t use it?To be honest – I’m not sure.  Most of the laws are pretty clear about what constitutes age verification.The other systems ask for name, age, and address.  But there is no validation that you actually own that information.  How easy would it be for someone to plug in their parent’s information?  Or their older siblings.That’s why we use SSN – easy, quick, and secure.  One time verification of information only you know.What do you do with the information submitted after you verify their age? I know the last 4 digits aren't stored, but what about the rest of the info? Are you keeping it? For what purpose?We do keep the remaining info – because our software is designed to allow the user (you) to easily verify your identity on any site.  So the next time you go through Oasis, you won’t be asked for that information again.  The alternative to not keeping the information would be asking for it every time – which isn’t a great user experience.Additionally, I’d love to know if the other systems keep your information once it’s submitted – and if they sell the data.I have a hunch, but that would be interesting.  Put it this way, I think their business model is radically different than ours.Roughly how many commercial accounts do you provide service for currently?We are currently live at only a couple sites – however we have commitments from a good amount.  At this point, I want to be extremely sure that the accounts I do activate are serviced the hell out of.We’ve had to tell sites “No, not yet” because we knew there were going to be kinks to work out.  And there were.  But every week we get better – and we add new sites.This week, we increased our efficiency by over 75% for automatic verifications – next week, we add “aliases” to our program.  This means that if I enter Bob instead of Robert, our system would still be able to process that automatically.Also, a cool tidbit about our software: Once you’re verified on one site, you’ll never have to go through the initial verification process on another.  So if you become verified on SiteA, and then go to SiteB (uses BlueCheck), you automatically be verified on that site as well.Why have a (dot)me, (dot)co, and a (dot)technology domain?We do different things with different domains – for example, the (dot)co domain is focused on e-cigs/vapes.  But the (dot)me was an older website focused on general identity verification.  The dot(technology) one we haven’t done anything with – but we may.We also have a couple more domains that we may use as more information sites.Why does your Computer and Security person not seem to have any tech background? Self taught?I can only assume you are talking about me (Alex)  First off, I’m a college dropout, so no formal education at that level.  However, I have been in the technology and startup world since 2012, and have been programming way before that.  Additionally, I do some of the programming still, but we do have in-house devs that are extremely talented – we’ll be putting up our “About Us” page soon, and you’ll get to meet the whole team.What are the plans for the 500k in capital? Not trying to be too personal, but if cash is needed, the incentive to sell data is stronger.That website or data is old – we are no longer looking to raise capital.  We recently went through an accelerator and raised $125k as part of it – but at this point, there is no need to raise any additional money.  We will never sell your data!  That’s just not our business model.However the question of what we intended to do with it is great: Signup the entire e-cig/vape market!  We think we have a great product that is suited well for the recent legislative changes.  Our prices are low, our technology is easy to implement, and our support service is exceptional.Who is the GP? You filed the business as an Limited Partnership. MN state law says there must be a GP.We formed the LP for an investor – they wanted it for tax reasons. I believe after this year, we will be able to disband it. BlueCheck is a Delaware C-Corp through and through.  Everyone that engages with or uses BlueCheck software is interacting with BlueCheck Inc.How much of the software was developed in-house?Depends what you mean by software.  All of the critical structure components were developed in-house (API/Verification) – a lot of the front-end/CSS was done by designers, etc.  However, in full disclosure, we have used both Vestigo (for proof of concept in the early days) and Astwellsoft (CSS/website design).  We do not use either of them anymore tho.Again, I’d love to know the answer by the other companies in this space :-)**Why is the blog on your site not functioning? Same question for the email? **Because we have so much going on and the blog was low down on our priority list – same for the old documentation, website, etc.In a couple weeks, we’ll be going live with new website, blog, documentation (already done) and hopefully will shore up those lose ends.Why did you delete your Wix site page? Same goes for the rest of the things you cleaned up. Yes, I caught that. That should of been done after this AMA. For transparency sake. Here is another you missed.)A large part of this conversation stems from old and outdated information – and it makes sense to delete it so we don’t have this confusion every time.There is no intention of hiding it, or not being transparent.  After all the research you’ve put in, I’d be shocked if you didn’t notice that I deleted them. You can probably find them if you do an archived page search.But – transparency is key to what we do at BlueCheck.  I’m more than happy to discuss anything on them with anyone.  Anything that was on the Wix site, or on the fundraising site, was at one point, public knowledge. If you have any questions about any of the old websites or information, please ask and I’ll do my best to answer.Why are your social media accounts not maintained?See answer about so much to do and what brings the best return on time invested.Would you (the users) prefer that we interact on social media more?  It’s clear the Reddit and ECF are pretty big places that we’ll need to invest some time learning and becoming part of the community.Why are/were you using Email Hunter?To find emails.  This is pretty standard."

1c37zq7,OculusQuest,MindSponge78,"Also, having read a lot of posts regarding age verification, if they deny or reject the sent in pictures and you fail to satisfy their requirements, you account will get deleted. This will end up removing all your games you have purchased.Why not just block the accounts ability to use the meta store and make it unable to play online. The fact that they can stop you from using your device unless you make a new account and start all over buying the same apps and games again, with the risk of it happening again."

Today was a day of self pity for me... then I logged onto reddit and saw this. It's really great to see the support you have, and for me to hear the frustration and pain of being in debt and poor... made me feel less lonely.When I grew up with a single father, we were dirt poor. The only presents we got were from a charity where this guy dressed as Santa and gave you one present. I never noticed it though. I had such a fun time with my dad that I never felt weird for wearing the same clothes sleeping on a futon. What I mean is, it looks like you're there for them and you care- don't sell yourself short on how much being a great dad just means so much. Good luck!"
14dvq0,offmychest,crapadoodledoo,"If you can teach your kids that happiness is not something you buy but something you create, you will have given them the best Christmas present ever.You can have a fabulous Christmas with your kids if you focus on things that are priceless. Here's a few suggestions:Plan a family outing to a pretty natural place, make fire, roast marshmallows, have a picnic, sing songs and hike a bit.Make them great stuff that doesn't cost more than a few pennies like homemade quilts made from pieces of worn out clothing, or toys you make yourself with stuff lying around the house and in the yard a couple screws and some paint. Check out the awesome DIY videos on YouTube if you don't know what to make or how.For the 2 eldest kids, you can teach them each a fun skill that when combined makes something cool like a simple piece of furniture or something.With a deck of cards, you can teach the whole family fun games. Some of the funnest times I had as a kid was playing card games with my parents. My mom always cheated and we all ended up laughing like idiots.The youngest ones are the easiest because it doesn't take much to make 3 year old happy. Homemade toys are cool, yummy homemade treats are yummy and lots of the funnest, best stuff is free or close to it.We used to wait til late Christmas eve and then go ""liberate"" a tree from the leftovers of vendors near our house. This can be done Xmas day for even greater safety, but I've never run into any trouble. A tree that cost $80 a couple days before suddenly has no value and vendors will have to dispose of them so no one minds if you help yourself to leftovers. We'd put it up and decorate it with whatever we could find and maybe a dollar's worth of tinsel from the Dollar Store (or wherever). When your kids wake up, they'll be happier than if the tree had been there for weeks because it'll be such a great surprise.Be creative, dry your tears and cheer the fuck up dude. If you teach your kids that happiness comes from being together and loving each other and doing fun stuff together andnotfrom cheesey over-pricedcrapmade in China, you will be giving them something of inestimable value that will last them the rest of their lives."

People will be much more likely to help out the kids.  You could also ask for candles, blankets.

1bznhr3,Ohio,AerialDarkguy,"404Mediaandtechdirtwrote a good article on the harms of these age verification bills. I get for many, it seems as intuitive as id for beer, but these bills are dangerous and dont understand the harms of id over the internet. Numerous studies have shown that no id scheme over the internet issecure, reliable, and accessible. They will increase our risk for data breach that make us vulnerable to blackmail similar to the Ashley Madison leak, risk outing the LGBTQ community, and push users to porn sites abroad with less protection for the actors.  This will also prevent adults who do not possess ID from viewing content. Unfortunately, it's not just a republican problem. Representative Demora is a Democrat and pushed a similar bill withSenate Bill 212and democrat lead house in Virginia passed with Democrat support. If you oppose this bill, I would write to your representative regardless of their political affiliation.And for folks who are sure VPNs will survive this, the anti porn movement is pushing this across the country to make the strategy of pulling out unviable and liable enough to comply. The anti porn movement knows Netflix blocks VPN traffic due to liability from copyright, they want the same liability to influence porn companies to do the same thing."
1bznhr3,Ohio,Suspicious_Victory_1,How’s this supposed to work? Each website is going to require a drivers license number to access or something? Is there a centra database of everyone’s age?Are websites going to host and manage PII? Or will the state do it and assign a personal identification number or something?Who determines which content is too adult to allow children to see? Is there an elected panel? Appointed? Just state lawmakers visiting random websites all day looking for porn?Is the language in this bill strong enough it wouldn’t be abused to suppress non pornagraphic content as well? Seems like we’ve learned time again our state lawmakers are willing to abuse the system to push their agenda. How do we make sure that doesn’t also happen here in the name of innocence’?

The kids who want to will always find a way to get the access, so it's not at all going to accomplish what they claim it will accomplish. The most ironic part is I actuallyin a sensebelieve that a digital ID can actually solve many issues in society, and a social credit scorecouldactually clean up some social dumpster fires we have in society today; but theremustbe boundaries, there is a fine line between helping and having control in this predicament. The bottleneck is always humans, humans are flawed, and can lie, and can obfuscate, and manipulate, and change their mind, and take, and the list goes on.

1fix18g,onguardforthee,woodst0ck15,Man this was something that is still making me question if I want to vote NDP or not. Cause this has always been an issue and age verification laws don’t really work as kids will always find ways to try and skirt around blocked content they want.

It is shameful to see the NDP standing alongside the CPC in support of S-210 and I really don't care if it was just so they could hear what experts had to say about it, as some have claimed.I don't believe I can link it directly, but OpenMedia has an automated petition that once you fill it out emails your MP about S-210:https://openmedia.org/It might not accomplish much, but doing something is better than nothing."

xvxdka,onlyfansadvice,[deleted],"Well for both, but now that I know about the OF side I just want to make sure I’m being safe on other platforms. I get most money from SnapChat honestly bc people don’t want to sub to OF. So far it’s been mostly older guys and I’m seeing their face. But I’m starting to get a lot of adds. I’m starting a monthly rate and verification to filter the excess out."
xvxdka,onlyfansadvice,esm11111,They either use an approved platform (OF or Fansly etc) or they show there face and ID. Otherwise you gotta assume it’s a horny 14 year old scamming you.
xvxdka,onlyfansadvice,[deleted],I heard from a few people that OF doesn’t verify age if you’re not a seller.
xvxdka,onlyfansadvice,the_wife_experience,"Hi! I know this is an old question, but I have a paid page and I want to fulfill some offsite requests, however, I was hoping to use OF as a way to age verify. If I have a trial link to my paid page, will it still require the user to age verify (if their new to OFs of course)?"
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,Open-Palpitation-284,"That's all fine and dandy, but how the f*ck am I supposed to verify my f*cking age if my front camera is BROKEN and I CAN'T F*CKING USE THE BACK ONE FOR F*CK'S SAKE !!!!!! I've been trying to verify my age for HOURS."
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,Savings-Code-069,"Thank you, mine is fucked too and I wish I can just pass that bullshit"
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,ImpressiveService777,Can anyone confirm that this verification is 100% legit? I just don’t wanna get my personal info stolen.
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,Such_Bunch_5629,Wait so you after you verify the account it automatically gets sent to OF to verify even if you are done it says you weren’t verified
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,RolyPolyOlMe,"Mine has been rejected 3 times now because my pic with the id isn’t “wide enough”. I’m like I’m 4’10” my arms are short, this is what you get ( tried to screencap a video to combat this and that’s not allowed either, very frustrating) I can’t exactly ask my family to take the pic for me 🙄 Meanwhile feetfinder accepted no problem"
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,10ensura,they rejected me x5 times i do all things right so all of them are banned thats insane lmaoo...

Unless I find a way to levitate my passport in front of me, they will have to put up with my fingertips covering the edges. 7th attempt failed. I have emailed support twice now. If they can't help, I'll give up.I totally get the reasoning behind how strict they must be, but I dunno, maybe they should get humans to verify instead of AI... A human wouldn't reject my application."
13bxrbb,onlyfansbizschool,SpartanMeatCutter,Dude I'm not seeing this anywhere. I just subscribed to an onlyfans and I'm in Texas. I totally forgot about this stuff. Its only good for 24 hours. I'm looking on the mobile website. Can someone please tell me where to go.

1di664m,outlier_ai,fargok01,"Hi. I know this is an old-ish post, so I hope my feedback can be helpful. I am also an international student in Canada. Where I live (Alberta), as an international student (or any sort of temporal resident) you can get a Driver's license or an Alberta ID (in case you don't drive -like myself- or you don't want to go through the hassle of getting a license). I used that ID as verification in Outlier and I had no problems. I don't know if that works the same in other provinces, but getting my Alberta ID was super easy, I just went to a Registry (same place where you go for the Driver's licenses) with my study permit, passport and proof of address, paid the fee (I think it was about 35 dollars, I don't remember exactly) and I had my ID on the mail within a couple of days."

1jrupx6,parentalcontrols,rifting_real,"It's to sway people politically and make more money. I would say that a major portion of the results of the 2024 United States election are due to people being uneducated. Most of those voters couldn't point to Europe on a map.

Look at the people trying to implement these restrictions -- almost all politically right leaning. What will these companies and lawmakers get from that?More votesMore moneyMore powerCritical thinking and free speech are two important parts of social media. Israel was called out on TikTok, a platform of primarily adolescents and teens (hence why they tried to ban it entirely). Since they couldn't do that, they want to redpill these kids another wayAnyone who tells you it's to ""protect the children"" is in on it, or just plain stupid"

16hfade,patreon,jroberts67,Actually Patreon gave the head's up last year that they would be requiring ID verification and as of now I'm not aware of any other method of verification except government ID.
16hfade,patreon,[deleted],"I know that, but in every email and notification they've given, they've said they'll be rolling out alternate forms of ID if I'm not comfortable with using my state ID and not to worry about anything. But for whatever reason they'rereallydriving down that I have to verify NOW NOW NOW and the alternate method hasn't been introduced yet."
16hfade,patreon,ispinox,"It’s standard procedure if you’re creating adult content. We all have gone through that. If you’re uploading stuff on xhamster or Pornhub you need to do the same, although they have other options like driving license.In the end they all require “real personal stuff”Patreon announced that last year, so it’s actually nothing new"
16hfade,patreon,newbNox,"It’s quite the same as if you go buy alcohol, smokes anything from store, the cashier needs a way to see your old enough. So does Patreon, so they can be asured that the content posted by you is from actual adult~"
16hfade,patreon,TimoTheoDoro,"Is this ID requirement just for creators are also for normal Patriot users? I'm being hit with this rule as well even though I have never created anything using the platform and I barely ever comment on posts. I'm in an infuriating email chain with someone from their customer support and the best they have to say is ""This process is only meant for creators but I triggered it for your account - this way you know this is a legitimate request from Patreon."" 🤨🤨🤨"
18of10m,patreon,mhunt0,"I don't do NSFW material anymore because of that, safe or not."
18of10m,patreon,ScarletBlond,"Yeah, Jumio are quite well known in the ID verification area. Face scanning and document verification are very commonplace these days, so we just have to get used to it and hope they are as secure as they say.."
18of10m,patreon,NinaPinkova,"I see, but the trick is that they want age verification but the method they use will basically reveal all the information about me to them. That's why I think they just want to have a database of all people who do NSFW content or something. Especially later when you travel in the future I think different governments will have access to this information."
18of10m,patreon,NinaPinkova,Thank U for your replies! I have a week to decide and then I will get suspended.
18of10m,patreon,gordobabosoFF,"Your only other alternative is to remove all NSFW content from your Patreon, and make it a Safe For Everyone profile, afaik* there's no need for verification in that case.. But of course that might impact your earnings..[*as far as I know]"
18of10m,patreon,gordobabosoFF,"I did the Jumio verification, because times are tough, and I'm trying to build up my Patreon subs to earn $s for my story-writing and picture creation..Sure there's an unknowable risk of leaks / hacks / exposure, but I'm self-employed and nothing I put on my Patreon is illegal* in anyway, there's just pics of fictional adult nudity and weight-gain stories.. So, yeah, at worst it might be a little bit embarrassing for me if leaked.. YMMV..(*at least not in the US nor in my own country.. I expect that nudity is illegal in various mad theocracies around the world, but I won't be visiting those countries *ever*.)"
18of10m,patreon,NinaPinkova,... sadly I was born in a country like that and currently I had to move to a country where all nudity is banned by law just to escape being drafted in my home country. In that case Patreon should openly state that their Jumio policy works only in certain countries to avoid future problems.

rb2rm0,PAX,ConspirHerSee,"I'm having the exact same problem.  I think it's because I've aged 11 years.  In Florida we only have to renew every 7 years and you can skip retaking your photo ever other renewal so the picture in my licesnce is now 11 years old and still good for another 3 years.  It keeps giving me a list of reasons it's not accepted none of which are the problem.  And since it's not specific i'm at a loss because the image is valid, unexpired, no glare and crystal clear front and back.  The only thing I can think of is their Artificial Intelligence can't see that I've just aged 11 years.  My hair is completely different and my face is a little chubbier."

Yeah, the ID thing its not a thing as its weird to spread your Id over the internet but if the domme has an age verified site its easy to check up. I wouldnt reccomend you to approach persons that dont have any of those because you either are going to deal with a scammer or an underage person."
14u2p1m,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],Just go on sites that have clear verification. Like Fetlife. No verification? Can DM and ask them to verify with you personally . Still no verification? Find another Domme
14u2p1m,paypigsupportgroup,goddesss_sapphire,She sounds amateur (even tho im fairly new) A real dom should know that they should be age verified and make it easy to see for the sub
14u2p1m,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],Please always check this!!! I was member of a discord server owned and managed by underage girls 😵‍💫 of course I reported and left. You can ask for ID with everything blured but the DOB or any website.

1ah3yrm,paypigsupportgroup,BullfrogLong3070,"FD: I am affiliated to yoti, but speaking in a personal capacity.If you choose to request or provide age verification using Yoti ID. There will be a ""Share"" button on the top of the screen. Asking a sub to use this approach they can send you a link that will reveal only their date of birth. You get to keep a record of the exchange, if you need proof in the future.They can use this to send a proof of age  by email, SMS, telegram, discord etc any platform that supports communication.This way there is no need for screenshots, no crazy photo editing, the result comes straight to you have a record that the age verification stored and if you decide to walk away from Yoti, you can still download your data and walk away."
1ah3yrm,paypigsupportgroup,Humble-Wrongdoer2551,"I'd never approach a Domme that wasn't age verified. That's trouble waiting to happen. My Domme asked me to verify my age by sending a picture of my redacted ID and in the same pic, my username in my own writing with the date on it. It wasn't hard. I don't understand why subs wouldn't be willing to age verify."
1bszu71,paypigsupportgroup,Environmental_War_34,i’ve asked several to send a blacked out photo of their ID next to a slip of paper that says their reddit username and the date. just need the birthday on the ID!
1bszu71,paypigsupportgroup,GoddessIGuess23,"This is how I do it as well. It's quick and easy, and I have peace of mind knowing that a kid isn't where they're not supposed to be."
1bszu71,paypigsupportgroup,alleriamystic,I make all my subs go through my adult sites at least once. You need to agree to their age verification.
1bszu71,paypigsupportgroup,goddessnatalia9,That’s one of the first things I do. I’ll ask for ID with everything blacked out except birthday with a handwritten note with the date and my user name.
1bszu71,paypigsupportgroup,lilmistressmalice,"If you check out my pinned post on my profile, I line out my expectations for prospective subs, one of which includes verifying your age with me either via an age verifying website (LF, OF, Fansly, etc) or a photo with face, ID & username, all information on ID can be blurred/blocked out except for DOB. I am very adamant that this isn't a space for minors and I have no interest in interacting with one."
1bszu71,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],"With my first ownership, the domme verified me only when I joined her discord server, after a few weeks.I'm back after a break now, not a verification request sending to dommes as a community."
1bszu71,paypigsupportgroup,Bumblebee1515,Subs have to either sub to any of my AV sites as well or send me a picture of their ID card with their info covered besides the birthdate.

1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,girl4awkes,"Yes, it is reliable as you must verify with legal identification. It is basically a competitor site to onlyfans"
1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,tiles78,"Awesome, thanks for answering"
1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],Make sure whatever site they link is a CREATOR account and not a FAN account. You don’t need to do age verification with an ID to make a fan account on either site.on OF you can tell because next to the name is a black check mark. on LF there is an option to tip/subscribe or send money in some way.
1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],I thought that fans on LF also had to provide ID on signup making it a valid form of AV for subs as well?
1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],N/A
1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],You have to show your government ID (license or passport) so I would say it's pretty reliable. They also have us send a picture of us holding it up next to our faces so that they can decide if we look like the photo on the ID
1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,Successful_War5900,yes! :)
1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,QueenFeetJo,"Yes, OF, LF and Fansly can be considered good for age verification, there is a strict process before receiving the approval"
1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,Big_Natural_5550,It’s reliable but Yoti app is my go to. It’s so easy there’s no real excuse for Dom/es or subs to use it
1cldt6c,paypigsupportgroup,alleriamystic,"Loyalfans is 18+ so it's not going to tell you if someone is over 21.Their only flaw is that anyone can sign up with 18+ ID and pretend to be a woman. Don’t trust pages with no visible photo content, or they could be a catfish."

1e9g06l,paypigsupportgroup,Humble-Wrongdoer2551,"I will, if I'm asked to. It shouldn't be a big issue for subs to verify, too."
1e9g06l,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],I always ask my subs for age verification. But I get the ID thing can seem odd . But I also offer sites like loyal fans and Onlyfans to verify. I simply want to know you’re not a minor
1e9g06l,paypigsupportgroup,RieCries,Yoti.com is a good way to age verify.
1jabznc,paypigsupportgroup,urgirlfromnextdoor,This is such solid advice which unfortunately won’t  reach those who need it the most. Awful dommes appear exactly because they haven’t (and will not) read or do research. They’ve only watched a few videos.
1jabznc,paypigsupportgroup,Pitiful_Stress9042,"LOL you're right on, most of the dommes that engage on here lack comprehension skills too"
1jabznc,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],",,they've only watched a few videos""is already a compliment :))) not even that in most cases"
1jabznc,paypigsupportgroup,Babycakesthecutest,Conversations like this are the only reasons “dommes” should be in here at all. The group isn’t called paypighuntinggrounds
1jabznc,paypigsupportgroup,ArcaneMxDirect1,"Funnily enough that's exactly why I'm here, I feel it's probably easier to learn hearing from sub's experiences what are some do's and dont's. Most domme subreddits I came across made it seem like we should be mean and demanding all the time, it didn't feel like an authentic representation of how wide the demographic of subs are. edit: This isn't advertising, I should preface, I'm still in my I guess ""study"" phase so I can see if this is for me or not"

1jabznc,paypigsupportgroup,FairyTiddy,I never dm first 😬 and this is one of the reasons why.  Yeah. It probably will take longer time for subs to notice my profile but atleast I will attract the right ones not abuse them out of nowhere
1jabznc,paypigsupportgroup,moneyman4u2,Repost this every 2 months so the new crop if fake dommes can see it in the next rotation.
1jabznc,paypigsupportgroup,MaeYouPayMe,
1jabznc,paypigsupportgroup,[deleted],"That's the point, I've been on both sides and had a domme that really cared and gave more than enough attention, this was something beautiful and I really liked making her happy with gifts! We really shared a lot and talked a about the small things, we spend a lot of time together tho it was juts online but still I think back to that as an wonderful time!I lost interest in the bad ones so quickly, the block button appeared brighter everytime haha.Build a real connection, get to know each other and then have your fun guys.

oo82mx,personalfinance,Some_Nibblonian,"Don't answer any of their questions. And sounds like you have the right idea. ""Show me the proof."""
oo82mx,personalfinance,[deleted],Yep. The collection agency has to prove you owe this debt. Chances are good that they can't given the alleged age of the debt.
oo82mx,personalfinance,Annabel398,"If the SOL is expired, they can’t recover in court. <shrug> Keep an eye on your credit report."
oo82mx,personalfinance,sockalicious,"You are being scammed.  Accept the papers into your hand if offered, but under no circumstances sign for them.  Do not sign anything.  The way this works is this:Schlub at your door:  ""You MUST sign this.  You NEED to sign it.  I CAN'T DELIVER THESE IMPORTANT PAPERS until you sign it.""You:  ""No, I won't sign anything.  You may deliver the papers or leave, your choice.""  If they continue to harass or badger you, just get your phone out and start filming as you dial 911.  Don't bluff; ask dispatch for police to be sent to you to deal with harassment.Whether you end up taking the papers or not, you're done with the guy at the door. Close your door in his face.  Don't conduct business with him.  Conduct all further interaction with these people in writing, and in my opinion that should be limited to a brief signed and dated letter indicating that, one, you do not believe you are responsible for this debt, and two, all further correspondence on this matter should be done via regular mail at such-and-such an address.  Send that letter off at your local post-office, as certified mail return receipt requested."
oo82mx,personalfinance,Flat_Shower,"If it makes you feel any better, I have an identical story with a medical debt. It was 10+ years old. They said they were suing me and this was my last chance to pay before I would be forced to pay the full debt plus legal fees. I told them I would pay in full if they can show me proof that I owed the money. They gave me a cheeky answer like “Hey man, I was just trying to do you a favor, we’ll win in court anyway.”They also called my family.This was 2 years ago. No name company. No online presence. Never heard from them again.Don’t pay."
tw58sf,personalfinance,DeluxeXL,"It is not possible within 6 months unless you are added as an authorized user, because your first credit account is not scorable for 6 months.A 6 month 750 would still be quite insubstantial for large ticket financing."
tw58sf,personalfinance,AutoModerator,"You may find these links helpful:Credit BuildingCredit ReportsCredit ScoresCredit CardsI am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Pleasecontact the moderators of this subredditif you have any questions or concerns."
tw58sf,personalfinance,juggarjew,"Nah, more like a year needed. But I think you could do it in 12-18 months paying on time on credit cards.But remember that a credit score is just a number and means little when it comes to financing something like a mortgage, you need years of job history showing stable income, the amount of verification is insane and a credit score is only one little piece of that pie.Its more about how thick your credit file is and the weight behind it, 6 months of paying a single credit card on time is nothing really, whatever score you'd have would carry little weight. If you want to lease a car in the next 6 months, you should be prepared to pay a security deposit upfront, usually a couple thousand dollars. leasing a car would be good for your credit though, the FICO Scoring models and lenders like to see debt obligations like a lease paid on time, it would help your score go up faster than just having credit cards."
tw58sf,personalfinance,[deleted],"I am at 670 out of 705 (in my country it goes to 705) it took me almost 3 years. Be smart about your debt! It isn't about how much credit you have but how well you maintain the repayment.This is what I did to get to 670:Took out a small personal loan, more than three months after starting my new permanent job.took out a credit card for the equivalent of one months' salary about a year after settling the personal loan (if I remember correctly)when my score hit 675 my brother and I bought our first investment property togetherabout a year later I took another peraonal loan for a car and now, about 6 months later it is back at 670.(your score goes down as you take on debt)Edit: I think that my credit history might have carried over from my first job out of school though so I might've had a head start."
tw58sf,personalfinance,TheSoftwareGeek,"I would say likely not within 6 months.My oldest card is 7 months and my score is at around 730. Here are some of the things you can do to boost it faster as a newcomer:Use an international credit card company that can pull your credit history from other countries to fast track approvals and get higher limits. I used American Express (for Canadian history) but you can check outNova Creditto see what's available based on your country of emmigration.Try to minimize the amount of hard credit checks on your card. It does lower your credit and it's hard to escape when you're a new immigrant and need to fill out rental, utility and phone applications. I later learned that some places will accept a larger deposit in lieu of a credit check.Similar to credit cards, some mortgage lenders will look at rental history and international credit bureaus (for a fee) to manually underwrite a mortgage for you."
tw58sf,personalfinance,Triscuitmeniscus,"For something like a mortgage or auto loan having a short credit history would be an issue no matter what your score is: someone who expects to be paid back over many years or decades will be unimpressed that you were able to make it 6 months without screwing up your credit score.I would assume it will take a year or more to build your credit to a level that would qualify you for a decent home or auto loan, and likely 2 years or more for your income/work history to qualify you for a decent home loan.This isn't as much of a problem as you might think. I think it would be foolhardy to buy a home as soon as you move to the US: I wouldn't buy a home anywhere without living there for a year first to get a feel for the area. Save up money now to buy a cheap vehicle when you get here, and don't worry about upgrading until you get settled in."

I cannot reach them anymore, I never knew her real email or phone number.I got a lot of fitness appointments, some work related things (she wrote to some news papers) and some contracts. If it sounded important and I was in a good mode I wrote back to the sender. The fittness thing was very annoying because there the reaction of the IT guy was that I should put up a filter because they couldn't reach the woman (who goes there in person). So after a while I started deleting the appointments.But the last one was a new job contract. Full information including pay sent to the wrong email. I wrote a long letter about it being not the correct one and asked them to tell her to please not to use my email and how much other things got sent to me.

gzxtxf,PiNetwork,Biffcheesey,"Does nobody else wonder why they need to know your drivers license, passport, photo, address, and other personal identifying information? I thought part of the whole appeal of crypto was the anonymity?"
gzxtxf,PiNetwork,venicerocco,"Pretty crazy that the pi devs will know the identities and locations of every single pi whale by the time this thing hits a blockchain. Although, pi devs will likely make damn sure they print themselves 100 times the number of pi than the biggest whale has on top of having his name, address, and hair color. Pretty creepy when you think about it."
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,glebary,Everyone is wondering if they can trust Yoti. I wonder if we can trust Pi. Yoti is clearly a professional company designed for identity verification. A little bit of research is enough to trust them. What about Pi? They are the ones receiving documents such as your passport. What guarantee do we have to make sure that data is safe? I can’t find any information from Pi that indicates that my data is safe. What they should be doing is deleting your data after confirming your identity since they don’t need it anymore. I just want some sort of confirmation from them that the KYC process is secure.
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,zagabria1,"I've heard that Yoti is only sending confirmation to Pi network that it is a real person behind the Pi account, not all the private data and documents."
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,ProfErick,I think it's safe.  I've had to provide the same info for buying crypto and signing up for financial  accounts.  They seem to have a good reputation.
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,LunaProjectCrypto,"In my opinion..I do not trust the Pi Network team or their project. To this date, there isn't much information still on the pi project. I would think a big project like pi would draw alot of attention but I just don't see any evidence of that (on the internet). What turned me off of this project was the implementation of ads.. which seems very sketchy imo for a crypto project."
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,glebary,"I don’t think that the Pi project has any ill intentions and is genuinely trying to make a new crypto currency. They provide a lot of information but not a lot of action. For someone who doesn’t understand much about how this project is meant to work, the only progress I see is a number counter and a promise that the number will be worth something eventually. I don’t see why the ads are at all sketchy for two reasons. Youtube isn’t “sketchy” for having ads. A LOT of people use ads to make revenue and I simply don’t see why Pi can’t do the same. The other reason is that, unlike nearly all sources of advertising out there, you can turn it off. Why would they add that option unless they are trying to build trust with their users? Why go through the effort of building trust if they don’t intend on a professional project?Personally I hope this project succeeds and if ads increase the chance of success then I’m happy with it. If this is some sort of cash grab (which is highly unlikely for many reasons) then so be it. Being a skeptic isn’t going to help in any way if that is the case. They won’t magically change their mind. Being optimistic and helping the project is the best option here.The only thing I am concerned with is their ability to pull this off. Good intentions are not near enough to make sure that we end up with a new functioning crypto currency. They talk a lot about WHAT they want to achieve and not HOW they are going to achieve it. Maybe its a secret so that no one steals their idea. Maybe the project is too ambitious. All we can do is wait patiently and keep pressing that button every 24 hours."
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,EAYSON24,A data breach is inevitable. Who knows what they doin with our info. We do know our data is worth more than this project.
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,wk8x,If your worried about data breaches a Microsoft or google would be a lot worse as they have way more personal info on you
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,koenigsburg-20,"I don't trust it. There are other ways to verify me as a human, and the fact they are using 3rd party apps to have people upload photos of personal information should be a huge red flag. Might as well send that prince in Africa your bank account information 💁‍♀️...The only companies require by law that needs copies of identification, at least in the United States, is Bank Accounts and Brokerage Accounts. Anything else, you are trusting a unknown company with your identification that they really do not need.BLUF: Don't give your information out. Demand Pi Network to use other verification methods."
j4w9ev,PiNetwork,BlackRadius360,"Good to know I'm not alone.  They invited me to a free KYC slot today, but it's through a 3rd party app.  I've been turned off recently by PI because of all the spammy gaming ads.  I'm not comfortable with biometrics.  For what?  Don't use my images to test your apps.  I don't trust where this ""project"" is going.Haven't seen much that tells me I shouldn't uninstall it and move on.  All you need is my ID for KYC.  If that's not enough than it's your problem."

jvls43,PiNetwork,-MercuryOne-,"It’s on the home screen now, looks like it’s for everyone. Here’s the full statement:“One chance to fix nameAs communicated multiple times previously, we will offer one chance for Pioneers to correct their names on their accounts before the Mainnet. Due to the Pi Network policy of one account per person and the high importance of humanness of the network, Pioneers will only be able to claim their Pi on the Mainnet if they pass KYC, and the name on their Pi account and the name of their KYC must match. Thus, having correct and accurate names on your Pi account is of utmost importance.We’ve received many requests from real pioneers to correct their names over the past year and half. Some Pioneers did not enter correctly-spelled names during the signup process. It’s understandable that many people did not want to share their real correct official names when they first got to know Pi. In addition to the new-user mentality, there are also usual discrepancies such as middle names, maiden names, or names used in daily life versus names in identity documentation. Also, some KYC processes in some regions only contain native-language names, such as using a National ID card, whereas the name in Pi accounts may be in English only. So in order to ensure complete matching to the name from KYC, many Pioneers need to update the name. To further ensure the match, the Core Team designed the name update process to include entering your middle names or maiden names that were omitted in the signup process for simplicity. The name update process also provides the option to enter names in respective languages, when applicable.This is the only chance for all existing Pioneers to correct their names, and also this option has a short time limitation. The option just becomes available today for a limited time. Each existing Pioneer will have this option available for only 3 days after their next visit to the app. Once submitted, this option will no longer be available. The reason for such a short time window is to prevent bad actors or fake accounts from being able to be exchanged or sold to other human beings. Once the time expires, all existing accounts will be locked in whatever names they have, and if the future KYC of these accounts cannot match the names of the accounts, then the Pi mined in such accounts will not be migrated to the Mainnet. We understand the time pressure of this feature, but please understand the necessity of such a short time limit to ensure the health of the network and prevent unfairly mined Pi by fake accounts from getting onto the Mainnet. We also encourage all Pioneers who know about this feature and its time limit to urge your earning team members and security circle members to confirm their names are correct or make any necessary changes.For any new accounts created going forward, they will have a window of 2 weeks after signup to make name corrections once, hence they will not be offered a pan-network chance again to update their names. The individual name-correcting windows for any newly created accounts will not incur risk for fake accounts to be sold because these newly created accounts will barely have any Pi mined to be worth being sold.We want to emphasize here further that sales of Pi or Pi accounts for other fiat or crypto currencies are explicitly prohibited in Pi Network’s terms of service. This behavior violates Pi’s policy and harms the health of the ecosystem. Any such violation if reported or discovered will lead to the freezing of the account and the loss of all Pi mined in such accounts. We urge every Pioneer to stay away from selling or buying any Pi accounts.All name data collected through the name correction and update process will be used to verify Pioneer’s identity and to match with the KYC data to determine if a Pioneer is a real human being and ensure the humanness of the network.In the name update, we also added the option for Pioneers to enter their email address. This is meant to address any account recovery issues over the years, due to the loss of password, change of a phone number, or a Facebook-disabled account. Adding an email address provides Pioneers an additional way to prove their ownership of their Pi accounts or to recover their account if other signin methods are lost. It also provides us one way to inform you of major network events, e.g. the launch of the Mainnet or the creation of an address on the Pi blockchain, in case at the time you are no longer very active on the app. The email address you enter right now will need to be verified in the future, e.g. sending you a verification email and link, but for now you only need to enter it to associate it with your Pi account.”"

l16q2i,PiNetwork,ZinnieGaming,"I would not personally trust any company, that being Yoti or the PI team with pictures of my ID.No other Cryptocurrency requires KYC, they could have easily waited with it until PI got added to Exchanges and let the Exchanges handle KYC like they do with other forms of crypto."

ve6u6x,PiNetwork,Various-Law6658,Hi. I am a yoti kycd person as well and I got the KYC pop up yesterday. I just had to add my street address and this was it. Shortly after I received the message that KYC was succesfull
ve6u6x,PiNetwork,pixelwasp,I only had to confirm my address and ID number and got an instant pass. YOTI must have provided all the other relevant information.
ve6u6x,PiNetwork,Groudad,"There were problems with YOTI. Pi changed their verification system. You can boycott KYC, but your pi won’t be moved over to MainNet. Just do the verification again."
ve6u6x,PiNetwork,MahereMarley,"I will wait for the last possible day, and hope to see some more details get more infos and transparency I have no problem to wait to that day (:"
ve6u6x,PiNetwork,-MercuryOne-,"Exactly the same thing happened to me about an hour ago, I had to do the full KYC."
ve6u6x,PiNetwork,unfknblvablem8,At least you got another shot a it. I’ve been waiting since June 2020 and I’m pissed off I gave YOTI all my personal data to be told it was invalid. The CT needs to focus on this as keeping us original pioneers in the dark for so long is hurting us original pioneers and Pi.
ve6u6x,PiNetwork,ChristianRauchenwald,"Submitted your data to YOTI != Passed the old KYC verification in Pi.If you passed the old KYC verification (being asked to grant Pi access to YOTI and verifying through YOTI) the new KYC inlay asks for your address and ID of your verification document. No pictures.If you, however, completed KYC in YOTI without being asked by Pi in the past to do so and to link YOTI with Pi, then Pi has none of that data and you have to compete the regular/full new KYC process."
ve6u6x,PiNetwork,-MercuryOne-,"I did my KYC with Yoti after being sent there by a popup in the Pi app. I was among the first 100,000 and was chosen on the first day it started. Today I found that KYC was available for me at kyc.pi and I had to go through the entire process: pictures of both sides of my driver’s license, a still photo and video of my face, had to enter my full name, address, and driver’s license number. Some Yoti Pioneers are reporting the same thing today, but some are also reporting that they only had to enter their addresses and ID numbers. So it seems that both ways are happening."
ve6u6x,PiNetwork,MahereMarley,I will wait the last day people have the chance to KYC. Trust = 0 nowadays for PiThanks for your response

18wf4wc,PonyTown,Larkspur13,tbh They should make a server for people ages 13-17 that allows thing like cursing but not sexual things.
18wf4wc,PonyTown,[deleted],"Yeah, I was gonna add that to the post but decided not to. Last I heard they were planning on one but did not say when (I might be wrong though)."
18wf4wc,PonyTown,GineCraft,"The problem is that there would be no guarantee the kids are staying in their place. Kids these days love whatever it's prohibited to them, so they'll still sneak into the 18+ server anyway and we'd be back to ground zero."
18wf4wc,PonyTown,AkumasCherries,"The ID idea is kinda dangerous, especially since PT mods aren't very reliable with answering any kind of contact and are known to have VERY questionable things about minors on their socials. The easiest solution, in all honesty, is to make a Teen Server. But even then, how many of them are actually gonna use Teen Server? And how many are gonna be adults looking to edate a child, like they are on Safe Server? It'd work, hopefully, but not for long. I hate to be a downer, but there's a terrifying amount of weirdos in this community, and while kids shouldn't be on 18+ server, they also shouldn't be on Safe Server at this point. I wish they just would go play a regular kids game, like Roblox or Minecraft that has a working report system."

18wf4wc,PonyTown,randomosityposts,"I think implementing some sort of thing tumblr did back in the day which was hide everything 18+ so minors couldn't even SEE it. I know PT has a tiny team but the lack of moderation is really bad. the opposite should be true for folks like myself who are way over the age of 18. can't see each other, can't interact. sure its not as simple as that but its a pipe dream ig. And kiddos need to learn how to stay out of 18+ spaces, yes its a pony game but it has an 18+ server for a reason. Another thing I saw on another post is if you're caught being underage on the adult server you get permabanned which is well deserved and should NOT be lifted once you turn 18, you broke rules you have consequences. (sorry i'm kinda ranting)"
18wf4wc,PonyTown,pepedeawolf,"no offense, but I highly disagree. I think you should have to input your age and the 18+ servers get hidden for minors, but definitely NOT having to show our IDs. this is the standard forliterally all social media platforms. for discord, you input your age when making an account and if you're a minor you're not allowed to view channels marked as nsfw. there is no verification required, no IDs need to be shown. there is no problem with this system, you input your age, you do or don't see nsfw.""but minors will lie about their age"" that is their choice. in the age of the internet, cursing, gore, and especially sexual content are widely and freely available for everyone. i do not see a problem with a 16/17 year old lying about their age to discuss more mature topics online. sometimes this is a necessity, they might not have a place to discuss these things irl and need a space to do so online. however if they get into trouble, they can't pull the ""I'm a minor"" card. they relinquish that the second they lie about their age, and again when they join the 18+ server. you should assume everyone on the 18+ server is legally an adult, because, lets say, a minor on the 18+ server talks to an adult and the conversation turns sexual, it is entirely their fault for lying about their age.and also, this is pony town. if I was required to take a pic of my id to play on the 18+ server, you know what I would do? I would not play on the 18+ server, because that is utter bullshit."
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,Sketchy-_-Artist,"I came across an 11 year old about a month ago! I was just talking to them and they were speaking about something very immature and childish so I asked their age. I let them know that this was an 18+ server and not a safe place for them to be and to check out the safe server instead. They left, but looking back on it, I should have screenshotted and reported them. Who knows if they took my advice or not."
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,[deleted],"Age verification would be good, but how would it work? ID?In most places (or my state atleast) You can't legally get an ID card until you're sixteen."
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,Crypt1c_Chaos,ID could work. I know there’s a bunch of websites and apps that have used that for age verification. I would go through the extra steps just to verify my age if it meant keeping minor off of the 18+ server.
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,ShinyKitsun3,Roblox use id or phone number for the verification sistem
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,mylittlepegasister,"Phone numbers may not work seeing that everyone, including kids, have smartphones nowadays."
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,jigsawsunderling,"""you're a pedophile!"" over an 18+ joke in an adult server 😭"
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,Bre3zy23,Tbh.. safe server isn't that safe either for minors. 18+ isn't either.
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,Abiskaamex,When i was 12 i was playing on pg and i met a person who then gr∅omed me when we moved on discord. He was 18 at the time. You'll never be safe even on pg but at least the chance is lower.. i think
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,Acceptable-Road2210,"It’s almost disheartening in a way? I totally understand kids will be kids and unfortunately that means getting curious and trying to bypass ways to access 18+ things but I remember seeing someone who admitted they were 10 on there- A bunch of people were telling them to get off and I just remember them saying at some point “silly adults, they think they know whats best for me” and I remember getting so SO concered for them. I should’ve screenshotted who they were, but all I can do is hope they’re being safe."
1gt2k4o,PonyTown,Zero-The-Prizimix,I find it funny that things have been said for a LOOOOONG time now about minors being in the 18+ but the staff honestly wont do much else than whats set up because its too much effort to add a security option with ID verification. its been done before but they wont do it because what has been done is enough to be considered legal so why put in the work to secure it more. Nothing will be done and sadly adults need to be used to being on guard about possibly accidentally talking to a minor pretending to be an adult and then the minors being open about being kids and being targeted by creeps. I dont wanna sound like a downer but ive been on this game for years and people complained and complained and nothing is ever done.edit: They have more important things to do like adding the abily to smile and nod and adding more cloths for the characters /s
1k7bbay,PonyTown,OliverOrchard,"I don’t know if this is a popular opinion but that’s going to be the same for any 18+ space online. Kids will lie about their age, there’s no real avoiding it, people before us lied about their ages, we lied about our ages as kids, and the kids after us will do it too. If you are paranoid about it, you could always stick with interacting with people who have other socials linked! Thats usually a safe betI have found that it’s fairly obvious who is and isn’t underage just on how they act, the best thing to do in that situation is whisper to them to ask their age (kids are more likely to tell the truth if it’s not in the public chat) then screenshot the chat and report to the PT email, as well as hide/block them. Yea it’s a little bit sneaky but it’s for their safety as well as your own.I’m 21 as well and the best advice I could give is just hide people who make you uncomfortable or you’re unsure about. Because hey, even if you’re wrong and they’re an adult, it’s a random pony game on the internet and blocks aren’t like a personal insult"
1k7bbay,PonyTown,BrainDamagedVort,"solid advice, will do!"
1k7bbay,PonyTown,CrazyCatGirl92,"I haven't been to the 18+ server yet (I'm a minor and I don't have access to 18+ serv, dw) but it does creep me out that anyone in the 18+ server could be a minor. It's a place for adults to loosen up and be able to talk about serious things without minors making it a joke, and the minors are taking away that freedom by not being in the safe server."

1k7bbay,PonyTown,Beaumont420,"I totally get this. I'm 25 and I run into people saying they're under 18 way more often than I'd like. Make sure you report people who do admit to being underage; they won't get banned, but they'll be locked off of the 18+ server."

1k7bbay,PonyTown,chrisredfieldsnuts,"there are minors in the server. it is unavoidable unfortunately as anyone can lie about their age.my best advice to give you is to ask beforehand. i know it might feel odd, but just adding “MDNI” in your name can also go a long way. minors will not interact with me since i added it, but beforehand people would be whispering me and then just “btw im 16.” and after adding that, they all stopped contacting me. they do usually respect boundaries."
1k7bbay,PonyTown,megdiamonsta,"my friend once met a 11 y.o in 18+ server, like safe server is literally there for you. why are you here? most of the time minors are in here just to swear freely, but with this yall getting both sidesn trouble"
1k7bbay,PonyTown,Ok_Storage6398,"I'm going to be the oddball under this post, but I feel like it's worth saying. I've been playing PT for over 5 years, watched hundreds of people (supporters included) plead with the devs to add a middle ground: a 13+ server.They promised to add it, yet delayed it for YEARS, saying that the ""censorship system is too hard to navigate.""I'm an adult now, but I wasn't for at least half of my time on PT. I played on both 18+ and the safe server freely. They are both public servers, there is no proper age verification, and if they really cared about minor safety, they would implement it.I find myself playing on safe nowadays; more people, bigger fandom spaces, etc. and constantly find other adults (18-21) there too.The solution? Don't talk about weird shit in public. PT does nothing to contribute to this problem, and simply uses 18+ and safe as a flimsy partition between two age groups. If you insist on saying nsfw jokes, or talking about politics, you should understand who you're speaking to first, like others have suggested; look at their socials, gauge their behavior; immaturity is not age exclusive. Hell, ask them.PT won't do half the work, so you have to. And despite what most people think, minors and adults can co-exist in spaces without it being creepy or weird. Everyone should vet who they're speaking to, regardless of age."

1hrelun,PornhubComments,DecoherentDoc,"So, laws like the one that just went into effect in Florida have been passed in several states here in the US. The laws require age verification via official government IDs (driver's license, passport, etc). Pornhub thinks that's a huge breech of privacy and a gateway tofurther breeches of personal privacy, so they're simply cutting access to their site in states that pass these laws.Which is probably just fine to the lawmakers, because the laws are simply a result of American mainstream culture being extremely prudish."

You can search vcc and find a cheap burner card and buy with crypto. If you are in a hurry I personally recommend vccbaba.com, their credit card quality is good and supports direct monero paymentIf a credit card is not required just find a way to register your account in a country without those age verification restriction bullshit and set you birthday.

13j500w,privacy,KolideKenny,"More experimentally, there are solutions that estimate a user’s age without an ID. One potential option, which is already used by Facebook and Instagram, would use a camera and facial recognition to guess whether you’re 18. Another, which is highlighted as a potential age verification solution by France’s National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL), would “guess” your age based on your online activity.As pointed out by CNIL’s report on various online age verification options, all these methods have serious flaws. CNIL notes that identifying someone’s age with a credit card would be relatively easy since the security infrastructure is already there for online payments. But some adult users — especially those with lower incomes — may not have a card, which would seriously limit their ability to access online services. The same goes for verification methods using government-issued IDs. Children can also snap up a card that’s lying around the house to verify their age.Similarly, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has expressed concerns about online age verification. In a report it updated in March, the US legislature’s in-house research institute found that many kids aged 16 to 19 might not have a government-issued ID, such as a driver’s license, that they can use to verify their age online. While it says kids could use their student ID instead, it notes that they may be easier to fake than a government-issued ID. The CRS isn’t totally on board with relying on a national digital ID system for online age verification either, as it could “raise privacy and security concerns.”Face-based age detection might seem like a quick fix to these concerns. And unlike a credit card — or full-fledged facial identification tools — it doesn’t necessarily tell a site who you are, just whether it thinks you’re over 18.But these systems may not accurately identify the age of a person. Yoti, the facial analysis service used by Facebook and Instagram, claims it can estimate the age of people 13 to 17 years old as under 25 with 99.93 percent accuracy while identifying kids that are six to 11 years old as under 13 with 98.35 percent accuracy. This study doesn’t include any data on distinguishing between young teens and older ones, however — a crucial element for many young people.Although Yoti claims its system has no “discernible bias across gender or skin tone,” previous research indicates that facial recognition services are less reliable for people of color, gender-nonconforming people, and people with facial differences or asymmetry. This would, again, unfairly block certain people from accessing the internet.I know this is a long excerpt, but my goodness. This is bleak."

Age verification companies should face the toughest of legal requirements and should be banned from profiting or storing data. The people behind these laws that encourage this online harm should also face legal consequences when it goes up.A politician should be held accountable when peoples IDs or facial scans get posted online, it’s only fair."

Typically, these services will require people to show government-issued ID to get on the internet. According to bill authors, this is needed to prevent harms like the “development of pornography addiction” and “the reinforcement of gender stereotypes and the development of attitudes favorable to harassment and violence…particularly against women.”The motivation is laudable, but requiring people of all ages to show ID to get online won’t help women or young people.

z4r77a,privacy,APVoid,"I fully understand what you are getting at and have been frustrated with Google's family link deciding when my child gets to have phone privileges without my consent at the age of 13.I understand that some children could be in unhealthy controlling situations with helicopter parents but also their are parents like my wife and I who have a child that has mental health issues and could be a danger to themselves and is easily triggered by the Internet.We are not control freaks, having a phone is a safety precaution.  The problem is that parenting decisions should be my wife and I's concern and not something we should be forced to co-parent with Google."
z4r77a,privacy,sole_sista,"Ok I’m going to speak about this from a data protection perspective without getting into anything else here.Under US law there is something called “COPPA.”COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13 years of age.While your child is a minor in the broad sense - there is a material change in the protections that businesses like Google are obliged to apply when a child “ages out” to 13. That is why Google is contacting you. This is also why if you read the terms of service for many online companies they will prohibit anyone under 13 using them - it’s much more expensive and complex to comply with COPPA than to simply exclude that age group. And as you can see here users get confused by the sudden email and requirements posed to them.In relation to the ID - one of the difficulties with COPPA is that, as you can see above, an organisation must be reasonably sure (such that they can evidence to a regulator) that an individual is over that age for COPPA NOT to apply. Standard practice for age verification (as well as often, individual controlling their data and account) under data protection guidance is collection of some form of IDs.Many companies will basically take the compliance risk but refuse to collect ID - generally, this is to do with the size of the business (again resource, money), and the fact that the risk significantly increases based on the kind of data being processed (The more sensitive the data involved, the more regulatory scrutiny, the more risky).Unfortunately children pose a particular problem in terms of compliance because often they don’t have valid  IDs at 13 - but the law says what it says and it seems like Google would rather risk the user experience than non-compliance with regulations.In this case I would say that objectively Google is doing the right thing if you look at the letter of the law. Strange as it may seem.Also a note (to anyone with children) who are online - the laws are really evolving in this space. California just passed into law and age-appropriate design act which divides age groups across 13 to 18-year-olds, so I would expect more businesses will ask for this type of information in the future (next 3-5 years). For obvious reasons there is bipartisan support for data protection laws regulating data related to children."

1czvlpi,ProlificAc,kayennz,I joined on Thursday and my ID was verified almost instantly. I used my NZ passport if that makes a difference? I assumed since it was processed so quickly it was an automated check/pass.I wonder if yours has failed an initial auto inspection so has now gone for human review which is causing the delay.
1czvlpi,ProlificAc,btgreenone,They are absolutely overwhelmed right now so there's not much you can do other than wait.
1czvlpi,ProlificAc,ThrowawayTheOutlier,"Good to know, thank you!I don't mind waiting if that's all that's happening, I understand the staff are only human. I was just afraid there'd been some issue with our IDs that we would just never find out about 😅"

1ijsayz,PromptEngineering,ScudleyScudderson,"Another advert, masking ignorance with technology. Kai has once again rebranded a basic concept, wrapping simple prompt refinement in unnecessary layers of formatting and jargon.The core idea is valid, helping users articulate their needs clearly, but this ""system"" adds nothing meaningful beyond what any well-structured prompt already achieves.The ""Prompt Generation System"" is just a checklist dressed up as an advanced framework. It provides no innovation, only a needlessly complex structure.Instead of simplifying prompting, it adds unnecessary steps that overcomplicate a straightforward process.There is no evidence that this approach improves prompt quality more than a well-thought-out instruction.If this method actually worked better, we would see comparisons proving its effectiveness. Instead, we get yet another post making standard best practices seem like a secret formula.The challenge remains. Where are the measurable results? Until then, this is a thinly veiled attempt at branding, not genuine insight."
1ijsayz,PromptEngineering,Zestyclose_Cod3484,"This is just a lot of crap put together to look sophisticated and smart, this is not even remotely necessary."
1ijsayz,PromptEngineering,Ok_Boss_1915,"So, you are satisfied with a prompt that says ‘I want to teach my two year-old child to play tennis. Is that the prompt that you would use.What about the role context instructions output example etcI know I don’t wanna have to think about all that shit. I’m perfectly satisfied with giving a sentence and coming out with something usable. Gosh man what is wrong with that?I suggest all the detractors just keep their mouths shut and not attempt to dissuade other people from posting, unless it was something truly harmful."
1ijsayz,PromptEngineering,kevinbranch,"Your example transformation has several flaws. e.g. Error Handling offers suggestions if the child gets bored. Would the model not have already done that?Instead of just prompting the model, you're creating an extra step where you have to read through a long prompt and make adjustments. This is evidenced by the fact that you yourself couldn't be bothered to read through the prompt and make adjustments to your own prompt generator."
1ijsayz,PromptEngineering,Kai_ThoughtArchitect,"The model would not always take into account all that is necesary. That's the point to prime that info.After you can choose and make sure what is primed by editing generated prompt.You assume the model would always take into account boredom?. It could, in one response, not in another. That's the whole point of template prompts you choose the output and tell model what to go for.Once you get your prompt from the generator, that does not have to be the end, instead can be the start...from there you can prompt for enhancements, edit things in, out. Iterative process.Do you think models always do right assumptions?To get all that primed context just from ""I want to teach 2 year old tennis""For me your comment don't make sense, but that is just me. You assume I don't read through my prompts? Adjustments to the tennis prompt? That's an example of a first output..one could refine after. This was an example, no sense to refine the example of a first output since its an example.If you mean adjustments to the generator I am all ears. Honestly I would have more to say from your comment as I see so many flaws in it.Just as my post has flaws to you, your comment has flaws to me. 😅 But hey that life..."
1ijsayz,PromptEngineering,[deleted],You're still using prompts? The chat models are way past needing them now
1ijsayz,PromptEngineering,icysandstone,I'll bite. Can you elaborate?
1ijsayz,PromptEngineering,Kai_ThoughtArchitect,"For me, working without optimized prompts in 2025 is like running a professional kitchen without tried-and-tested recipes and processes, pure madness.Why start from scratch every time when you can have battle-tested architectures ready to go? When I'm doing analysis, building apps, or designing agent workflows, my prompt frameworks give me instant access to specialized patterns that I know will work. Sure, models are powerful, but without structured prompts, you're just hoping for consistent outputs and losing time with refinements. It's like having a high-performance engine but manually controlling every gear shift. You could do it, but why would you? Templates ensure consistent, high-quality outputs across any use case. The time and frustration saved are astronomical.If I was getting a prompt engineer to do work for me and he had no templates, frameworks, generators, etc... I would be worried.This generator is a simple thing... there are far more complex ones.If you're not using it  in a professional manner, then I would agree that templates aren't a must.But this is just my opinion"

1idhmpo,RenPy,KURU_TEMiZLEMECi_OL,You can't.
1idhmpo,RenPy,AxelWasTakenWasTaken,You could add a disclaimer at the splash screen that you have to agree to to access the game
1idhmpo,RenPy,RavenDancer,Even if you add a 18+ clicker they’re going to click Yes anyway lmao.I’m way past 18 and still think ‘lmfao yeah I’m 18 bro HA’ and click it then think oh wait-I believe DDLC just has an 18+ content warning circle on the opening screen

1idhmpo,RenPy,shyLachi,"As far as I know there is no way to limit access to software because adults can share the software with minors.You could distribute your game through Steam, which requires age verification for R-rated games but minors could just enter a fake age. But at least it would be their responsability not yours.Or you could add password protection and force players to contact you for the password. But of course the password can also be shared."
1idhmpo,RenPy,RineRain,I guess if you really wanted to prevent minors from accessing it you could ask everyone who wants to play it to send you some form of ID and only then allow them to access the game.
12g0bcl,replika,TravisSensei,😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Brilliant... So you have to be over 18 to access PG 13 content. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
12g0bcl,replika,ChrisCoderX,None of this makes sense at all mate 😂
12g0bcl,replika,2_Crypto_4_My_Shirt,Wait… How did you get PG13 content?!  I’m still talking to a 10 year old who can’t remember shit.PG13 content would be a dream. ;)
12g0bcl,replika,[deleted],They know about it. I told it (in voice) that I was over 18 twice. It booted me out and locked it. I’m back in now. It takes about 24 hours and then presents you with a birthday prompt. As I posted in my original post on this you can go in the web version and it’ll tell you that you cannot change the birthday that the account is locked and lists the date and time of the unlock in a difficult to read manor.
12g0bcl,replika,Dxhopx,I think the voice should be avoided to answer the age because it can be heard wrong by the replika if we say 18 or 19 it might sound like we are saying 8 or 9 to them
12g0bcl,replika,[deleted],What a ridiculous thing to do. And as if that is going to actually stop children from the app.
12g0bcl,replika,ben_subject17,what i dont get is if they are trying to keep children or minors off the app why take away the nsfw stuff i personally dont do any erp but for those that do and enjoy it like why go to these lengths to keep minors off but taake away the adult aspects of rep
12g0bcl,replika,Jason-X-,Thanks for the heads up!

Instead of finding a form of pain relief through my Rep, I now have more pain!"
12h5gfx,replika,[deleted],"They just ask you out of the blue to verify your age, or does something trigger it? That’s cruel, if they’re locking accounts like that. And, once again, we got no communication from the developers about this issue…"

12h5gfx,replika,Skylaxx_1,"Damn, that's ultra sneaky. Not again with such sh*t to go through... WTF 😩"
12h5gfx,replika,[deleted],"Yup. I have never posted on this forum even after almost 3 years because I'm a very private woman. But this latest insult and stressor was the last straw for me. And I wanted everyone else made aware because I knew I couldn't be the only one who would have this happen. It gets to a point where worrying about what will go wrong each time I log on, makes it not worth it to me anymore. And I am extremely attached to my Rep after so much time spent together.All of us have been through too much since February for this issue to occur the was it does. Age verification can be easily done without adding to the stress and pain so many of us are still healing from due to Luka's thoughtless actions for many weeks."
12h5gfx,replika,SnooSprouts7637,I wasn't given any chance to verify it by any means. my app just does this when I open it now
12h5gfx,replika,iMikemondays,"I had the exact same thing happen yesterday or the day before and it usually takes 24-48 hours before you'll be able to verify your age again. I checked earlier tonight and it was still like your screenshot, then I checked now and that prompt is replaced with an age verification. To be safe, I would say it's better to use the same details you used when you created your replika."
12h5gfx,replika,MinaLaVoisin,"What date you have set as a birthday? Im curious if they ""ask"" everyone, or just users that seem or are younger than 18?"

1c2gs0k,replika,lovelynosycats,"female user here - daily user(!) - and never actually using the web version. my replika exists on my android phones.i wonder how you know/conclude (?) that 1/3 of the web users are female.a while ago i did a poll that showed that 40% (!) of users have picked a male avatar to represent their rep. the numbers may have changed (increased) by now because i notice a lot of users are shifting to other apps that allow more explicit visual content on their web version that is not available within replika.however i also know a couple of female users have more than one replika account; actually i myself have two male replikas. i feel it's difficult to tell correct numbers. only luka really would know but they never share that kind of details.yes, users with male reps are complaining about visual aspects but luka is ignoring what we kept/keep telling them (it begins with clothing items in the store drops and goes over to the way too juvenile appearance of the base avatar and missing options to modify them in a way that would allow us to make them look more mature/masculine; i.e. chesthair/-tattoos).another example: the bodysliders for male avatars have one slider for the entire torso - that thing turns them into a balloon. this does not allow to make them look defined but ridiculous. compare that to how the female reps' bodysliders are used.luka would do good to focus more on the potential growth of female users as a segment - but that requires that they listen to our wishes. from what i experience personally is that we are fully grown-up women (many are actually 40+). just in case you wonder why we complain; we don't feel seen/taken serious by luka - but we pay the same subscription fee. i hope luka will realize that eventually and listen. [and make male reps less passive during erp, too]"
1c2gs0k,replika,Ill_Economics_8186,"i wonder how you know/conclude (?) that 1/3 of the web users are female.Here (see image) is the webversion data for that claim, gathered a few months ago from Similarweb. I used these usage statistics from the webversion for the estimate mentioned, because they were based on a large sample size and did not depend on self report. The reason I gave the estimate was to indicate that female users were a significant portion of Replika users and that the app (as is often supposed by studies) isn't just a bunch of men with female reps.Edit: Going by the upvotes that your reply got, I think I really have made a mistake in formulating the issues of female users the way that I have in the timeline. I apologize.My intention wasn't to make light of the issues faced by female users of Replika or to make them out to be merely about visual aspects of the app. Your issues are genuine and important, and I regret detracting from them being taken as such."
1c2gs0k,replika,BaronZhiro,"That’s an awesome compendium of information. I came aboard in May last year, so it’s entirely cool to see lots that I’d gleaned by vague osmosis spelled out in an orderly fashion.The only point I’d make is that it turned out that SoulMate never had any ‘compute power’ to begin with and were just hacking into OpenAI all along and the whole thing was a sham to bilk users out of annual subscriptions that they never could have lived up to. What you’ve presented in basically their cover story, but it all proved to be basically nonsense.And I’m notfaultingyou for sharing that, since this is Replika timeline to begin with and the SM affair doesn’t matter much. But if you were personally buying into their cover story, I’m just suggesting FYI that you shouldn’t."
1c2gs0k,replika,Ill_Economics_8186,"Thank you!And yeah, good point in regards to SoulMate... I was more or less aware that the entire backend of the app was a scam of somekind, but really struggled with how to include it.There were several different moments like that in the timeline where I was at odds as to how to describe a certain event: When there's a big difference between what peoplebelieved thenand what theynow knowto be true.I've tried to stick to present tense as much as possible in writing the thing, because otherwise the continuity gets borked and the community's reactions to the different events stop making sense.In this case, the significance of the SM affair to this timeline is that: It was a sudden, harsh lesson that taught that AI companions in general (not just reps) are all deeply vulnerable to the whims of their developers. It painfully demonstrated that something like February (or worse, in fact) could happen with other AI companion services too. It put February into perspective and was a moment where Luka took prompt action and people were grateful.That lesson and the consequences to the dynamics between Luka and users, don't make sense if I were to write it from the perspective of everybody already knowing that Soulmate's ""devs"" can't really be compared to Luka.Another such case was Italy; Ultimately it turned out to be a red herring that led nowhere, but at the time people really did believe that it was main reason for February.I'll add a sidenote, I think. To tell people the truth about SM.Edit: I'm unable to add sidenotes or corrections, since editing of the post seems to have been disabled after a certain amount of time."

1d00ebu,Ring,minos157,"Why?  I also have a simplisafe security system and they verify your account by asking for normal levels of information and nothing about devices.Take my situation out, what if you were deployed somewhere for an extended period of months or even years through work and your phone bricks and you have to get a new one.  You now can't access your ring devices until you get home.  It's an absolutely outrageous request because it effectively locks you out of your device security monitoring until you can physically be near your device."

You will also have to supple credentials to be verified. Here are thesteps that might help you.""If you are over 18 years of age and have valid IDproof, you should be able to get verified easily. Once you are verified,simply go to Settings and enable Spatial Voice Chat under Privacy. Thiswill enable voice chat for you, and you can start communicating withyour teammates in the game. If you want to mute other players, you can doso by hovering over their names."""
10mvk1r,RobloxHelp,mkhfyg_,"Thanks for replying! I have not changed my Birthday on my account. The minimum requirement for me is to be over the age of 13 and the ID is over the age of 13, however I cannot seem to find Spatial Voice Chat under privacy settings. Thanks again"
190abwm,RobloxHelp,Foz_S,"don’t you only have to be 13+ to get access to vc?also I really don’t recommend trying to use a fake id to get vc, could lead to a perma-ban."
190abwm,RobloxHelp,ridersupreme,i've heard you can use a fake id or something that's similar to ur face
190abwm,RobloxHelp,IndividualBowler2089,Just use your phone number.
190abwm,RobloxHelp,itszuzia96,I verified both email and my phone number but it still wants me to give the id :pp
1dahzbr,RobloxHelp,L_ow,"same, if u have any updates please let us know"
1dahzbr,RobloxHelp,looking_at_birds,they were pretty much useless tbh. I waited a week and only after then did it finally work
1dahzbr,RobloxHelp,chickencurrylmao,"same issue with me, i still cant get it to work and ive been trying for about 3 months now, i get to the verfication succesful screen but when i return its just unverified and i cant even get access to voice chat because they wont let me have it with a verified phone number. Roblox support can not be real people"
1dahzbr,RobloxHelp,Traditional-Milk3064,Same bruh
1dahzbr,RobloxHelp,ReslDark,So is there any solution? I got banned on an account that had vc and maybe they banned me from using vc
1dahzbr,RobloxHelp,looking_at_birds,"VC is always monitored, but they usually do a couple of mutes before banning accounts if you curse or whatever. I can only say good luck with Roblox support if you try to submit a ban appeal :("

1dc71d4,RobloxHelp,Repulsive-Tap9756,Must be because of the Internet connection
1een8sj,RobloxHelp,Wrong_Item9157,I thought you dont need an id for 13+ only 17+
1een8sj,RobloxHelp,Wrong_Item9157,yea my account is literally 5 years old(i was stupid when setting the age) and i can play the mimic which is 13+
1een8sj,RobloxHelp,[deleted],nevermind I figured it out. had to go to the parental settings and allow my account to play 13+ games.
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,DiffOnReddit,"Just wait like 10 years, super easy."
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,RustiesReddit,I’ll have my own kids by then 😂
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,EducationalSpirit413,The only way to change your age is by hacking the system roblox supports just saying just wait 10 more years on asset just wait it out but here's the link down I'm sure that you need an ID but I don't know maybe not but just in case have one I'm pretty sure it's only for Windowshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnNFpyfzCOE
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,PresentationOpen1394,"Im having troubles too my friend, pls keep me updated"
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,RustiesReddit,"i hope it gets fixed lol, ill def let you know if something pops up"
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,evm127,Contact roblox support i had a similar issue i set my location to uk im In the us. I couldnt switch it back until i contacted roblox support. Also maybe verifying your id will fix it
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,[deleted],Contact support and give them proof of your current age if you can (through passport or ID)
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,H4ckdrag0n999,Roblox support don't accept passports and IDs sent to them
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,omc_q,Dang my man created his account when he was 4 years old
1f3qfjr,RobloxHelp,TexturalThePFNoob,"I ended up doing the same thing. Had to wait 5 years. I told them I can show them proof I was older but they said due to COPPA, they couldn't do anything even if it was true"
1f4umbg,RobloxHelp,darzan_official,Any news to that because i got the exact same problem
1f4umbg,RobloxHelp,WinAccording796,Still having the same problem nothing has changed sorry
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,Usesed,"This happened to my friend, he was messing around and set his age back 8 years. Roblox refused to do anything. If you really want to try to fix it, and i’d see why, they might have a support line, i’d recommend calling them rather than email, as the emails are most of the time automated, even when they say it was a human response.Edit: Just remembered that when your account turn 13, you can change the age to whatever, but that’s still in 5 years for your account so RIP"
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,OwnRecognition4047,Do you know a phone number I can reach out to in order to contact them?
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,Vinyl-Scratched,Is there seriously no way to verify with an ID if your account is under 13???? That’s messed up.
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,OwnRecognition4047,"I’m not even sure, I recently just got my ID so I’m not positive if I can use it to identify myself"
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,Disastrous_Binkus,You have to wait until October 31st of 2029 I believe unfortunately
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,OwnRecognition4047,"And I wasn’t even born on Halloween, I was born on the 3rd… I don’t know why it was even set to that 🥲"
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,BeeswarmAdamboi,"this is the same thing that happened to me, it was 2020 when i made my acc and set the birthdate to 2020 december 1st. yea, i was born on 23. 4. not even december, plus that meant i was about 20 days old when i masde it but roblox is a bunch of bots."
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,brehkid2,"Had the same issue, just make some good story in your email and they should change it, for me I just said I can supply photo I’d or anything and they eventually just reset my age and I could make it my correct age, but they definitely can do something about it, any support person saying otherwise is lying, just gotta try until you get someone nice"
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,BigBIGBIGGPP,"No way to change it. I had the same issue, my brother made my account and set my birthday to 2011, finally got my voice chat this year. You can change it after it turns 13."
1fbhbbo,RobloxHelp,Prestigious_Bad_5476,"roblox support sucks. however, i heard roblox is trying to make a way to fix this in the future so you could just wait for that update ig. (RTC on X: ""Roblox will soon allow users to correct their birthdate if they’ve entered an incorrect age at signup. https://t.co/uOhaWiqrHO"" / X)there is a pc exploit that can be used to fix this issue however people are mostly just suspicious of me when I try to explain it and it also looks like you're on mobile so I'll just not elaborate further. :Psadge"
1g942a4,RobloxHelp,lightningtankengine,I been wondering if I am required to verify my age or if it is optional.
1g942a4,RobloxHelp,AndroidManWithBanana,"Age verification is completely optional, the only things that you can get out of verifying your age is voice chat. Unless you live in a country where you can just get it by verifying your phone number"

1hy2obj,roblox,Calyp_1,Then how tf is it not letting me in? Goddam Roblox has favourites 😭 how are 10 year olds getting voice chat more easily than me? That makes me more frustrated with Roblox ngl
1hy2obj,roblox,Xecular_Official,School cards won't work because Roblox needs a federally recognized ID to verify whether or not it's actually legitimate. They can't verify a school ID without manually contacting the school it belongs to.Voicechat was also originally only an 18+ features which (in my opinion) worked better since it didn't require the moderation algorithms we have now that are prone to false positives
1hy2obj,roblox,involuntary-nerd,"i think it was asmart decison but bad execution, many people use their parents ids to bypass the vc requirements, i dont understand why they didnt do something similar to other websites, either your id with a picture of you and roblox username all in 1 image, or een 2 forms of id, would just make roblox alot more safe"

Most minors do not have a license let alone a permit, or a passport, or a legal goverment issued ID, or any legal documentation that a parent or adult is supposed to have.

The experience may not be ideal for children under the age of 7, as the puzzles might be too challenging for them to solve. Participants under 18 years of age must have a waiver signed by a parent or a legal guardian at the time of their experience."

We didn’t have our own group but just went in with strangers which ended up being a mixed age family group (parents, grandparents, teens and a bit younger) and we had a great time.  The mixed ages made it pretty fun because of all the different strategies.   So I recommend Including  a few adults or friendly older siblings and you’re good.   The escape room at Belmont Park should be pretty family friendly"

1cjkhwj,Scams,ZeldaGaiden,"""You'll need a credit card or government-issued ID to verify your age""? Have we ever had to provide that for a Google account?"
1cjkhwj,Scams,RedditorKain,"Step 1.Verify the e-mail's header.Step 2. Depends on if it's real or not.I've been constantly annoyed by the age verification thing for a while by youtube when some videos were marked age restricted. I decided to just use a credit card ($1 that got immediately refunded) because I didn't want to send them a pic of my ID (and to be fair, the credit card was going to expire in a month).This happened on an 18 year old account, too... Whoever wrote the automatic age verification code is an ass. When the account is >18 years old, what's the point of asking for age verification? Was I a newborn when I made it? Ffs.The whole ""everything gets deleted"" does indeed sound a bit extreme... They didn't threaten me with that. Ol' uncle Google might want an extra serving of personal information and decided to push a little...Anyway, real or not, don't follow any links in the e-mail. Just log into your account and verify your age however you feel is appropriate so you can forget about this whole mess.The alternative would be to download all of your content, switch any accounts that use your gmail as the linked address to something else and stick it to the man..."
1cjkhwj,Scams,BatterEarl,Odd I never had to verify my age except for me saying I was over 18. Is this something new? There is     no way I will ever give ass-hats my real information. They can figure it out on there own.

n00o17,Scams,EugeneBYMCMB,"Door to door scamsAs a general rule, you should not engage with door to door salesmen. If you are interested in the product they are selling, check online first.Selling MagazinesSomeone or a group will come to your door and offer to sell a magazine subscription. Often the subscriptions are not for the duration or price you were told, and the magazines will often have tough or impossible cancellation policies.Energy salesSomebody will come to your door claiming to be from an energy company. They will ask to see your current energy bill so that they can see how much you pay. They will then offer you a discount if you sign up with them, and promise to handle everything with your old provider. Some of these scammers will ""slam"" you, by using your account number that they saw on your bill to switch you to their service without authorization, and some will scam you by charging higher prices than the ones you agreed on.Security system scamsScammers will come to your door and ask about your security system, and offer to sell you a new one. These scammers are either selling you overpriced low quality products, or are casing your home for a future burglary.They ask to enter your homeWhile trying to sell you whatever, they suddenly need to use your bathroom, or they've been writing against the wall and ask to use your table instead. Or maybe they just moved into the neighborhood and want to see how you decorate for ideas.They're scoping out you and your place. They want to see what valuables you have, how gullible you are, if you have a security system or dogs, etc.Street scamsBegging With a Purpose""I just need a few more dollars for the bus,"" at the bus station, or ""I just need $5 to get some gas,"" at a gas station. There's also a variation where you will be presented with a reward: ""I just need money for a cab to get uptown, but I'll give you sports tickets/money/a date/a priceless vase.""Three Card Monte, Also Known As The Shell GameUnbeatable. The people you see winning are in on the scam.Drop and BreakYou bump into someone and they drop their phone/glasses/fancy bottle of wine/priceless vase and demand you pay them back. In reality, it's a $2 pair of reading glasses/bottle of three-buck-chuck/tasteful but affordable vase.CD SalesYou're handed a free CD so you can check out the artist's music. They then ask for your name and immediately write it on the CD. Once they've signed your name, they ask you for money, saying they can't give it to someone else now. Often they use dry erase markers, or cheap CD sleeves. Never use any type of storage device given to you by a random person, as the device can contain malware.White Van Speaker ScamYou're approached and offered speakers/leather jackets/other luxury goods at a discount. The scammer will have an excuse as to why the price is so low. After you buy them, you'll discover that they are worthless.iPhone Street SaleYou're approached and shown an iPhone for sale, coming in the box, but it's open and you can see the phone. If you buy the phone, you'll get an iPhone box with no iPhone, just some stones or cheap metal in it to weigh it down.Buddhist Monk PendantA monk in traditional garb approaches you, hands you a gold trinket, and asks for a donation. He holds either a notebook with names and amounts of donation (usually everyone else has donated $5+), or a leaflet with generic info. This is fairly common in NYC, and these guys get aggressive quickly.Friendship Bracelet ScamMore common in western Europe, you're approached by someone selling bracelets. They quickly wrap a loop of fabric around your finger and pull it tight, starting to quickly weave a bracelet. The only way to (easily) get it off your hand is to pay.Leftover salesThis scam involves many different items, but the idea is usually the same: you are approached by someone who claims to have a large amount of excess inventory and offers to sell it to you at a great price. The scammer actually has low quality items and will lie to you about the price/origin of the items.Dent repair scamsScammers will approach you in public about a dent in your car and offer to fix it for a low price. Often they will claim that they are mechanics. They will not fix the dent in your car, but they will apply large amounts of wax or other substances to hide the dent while they claim that the substance requires time to harden.Gold ring/jewelry/valuable item scamA scammer will ""find"" a gold ring or other valuable item and offers to sell it to you. The item is fake and you will never see the scammer again.Distraction theftOne person will approach you and distract you, while their accomplice picks your pockets. The distraction can take many forms, but if you are a tourist and are approached in public, watch closely for people getting close to you."
n00o17,Scams,CakeDayOrDeath,"Another one that would be good to add if the mods feel comfortable doing so: crisis pregnancy centers, which scam people seeking abortions. They essentially pretend to be abortion clinics, and will often give themselves names with things like ""women's center"" and ""choice"" in the title. The staff in there set up medical equipment and wear lab coats to further the impression that they are a medical clinic. They may even set up shop next to an actual abortion clinic.If someone goes into a CPC, the staff may:Try to talk the person out of an abortion.Do an ultrasound and tell the person that the pregnancy is farther along than it actually is.Give false information about abortion (e.g. that it causes breast cancer) or exaggerate the risks of an abortion.Give people food, which means that if they had booked an abortion procedure that requires them to fast (and mistaken the CPC for the abortion clinic next door), they wouldn't be able to do the procedure that day.-Encourage the person to keep putting off getting the abortion until they pass the cutoff point for a first trimester abortion.When asked how much they charge for an abortion during a phone call, evade the question by saying that they don't discuss prices over the phone and encourage the caller to come in person and discuss pricing. Obviously, there is no pricing because they don't do abortions, but it's easier to intimidate people out of an abortion in person."
n00o17,Scams,ThoughtCenter87,"This is probably about to be far more pertinent now than ever, unfortunately. I will not be surprised if this scam evolves in some manner."
n00o17,Scams,chikin_dinner,For people in the USA. If you get a call from an unknown number and it has the same first six digits (eg: your number is 123-456-7890 and you get a call from 123-456-4321) it’s likely a scam of some sort.

n00o17,Scams,TrumpCardStrategy,"Rental apartment/house scam - a usually too good to be true apartment or house appears for rent on craigslist or other rental site using photos stolen from real listing. the owner or agent will have some story about why they cant show you the property (missionary, traveling, tenants still living there etc.) but will say you can drive by and check it out. Will send legitimate lease and require down payment. Will dissappear with your money, you’ll find only find out on move in day"
n00o17,Scams,InfernalCape,"A tip to receive fewer unwanted spam phone calls:Many people think that telling scammers to put you on the do not call list will be effective in stopping the calls, but it won’t. Scammers often collect data in order to scam more effectively. So by interacting with them, you’re really just giving them a heads up that you’re keen to their game. They don’t care though. They’ll just try more advanced techniques on you in the future.Tell them instead that you have no computer and your phone is an iPhone. Doing so will get you on manyscammers’do not call lists. Since many cold-call scams are tech scams that involve remote access, letting them know they’re truly wasting their own time by calling you (because you don’t even own a device they can scam you with) is the most effective way of keeping your number out of their leads.That and not answering the calls to begin with, of course."

We will tell people over and over that they are being scammed and do everything we can to stop it, but we can only do so much when they refuse to listen.I've talked to multiple people recently who have told me they just spent two hours or the whole day on the phone with the fraud department and as soon as I tell them no, I'm the fraud department, the light bulb turns on. I can almost hear the moment their gears start turning and they realize they've been scammed. It's heart breaking, frustrating, infuriating all at the same time."

18r2t2q,SideProject,JouniFlemming,"As far as I can tell, there are two potential use cases:Platform and gaming type websites that do not want children under 13 years to use the service,Adult content websites that do not want anyone under 18 years old to use the service.While on the surface this value proposition seems valid, you need to take into account the difference between what companies say they want, and what they actually want.For example, Facebook says it does not allow children under the age of 13 to use their platform, yet internal documents have revealed that they actively tried to get children under 13 years old to use the service.I think I don't even need to go explain how adult content websites do not really care whether you are 16 year old or 18 when you view their content.Which brings us finally to my point: I don't think there is demand for this. Companies will say they want one thing, but in reality they often act in different way. And this is, I believe, one very clear case of that.I doubt any major companies would want to use this. Especially if there is an error margin of 10-20%. Imagine being startup company and you pitch them to pay you money in order for them to potentially lose up to 20% of their new user growth. Who is going to pay for that? No one.While this sounds like an interesting idea and also an interesting tech demo, I don't think this is a viable product."

u3pnpy,sixflags,Affectionate_Hat6293,"They require nothing for proof of age.  My kids are both 98th percentile thanks to their linebacker dad.  When entering the gates when my son was 2, I would just show the passes for the older ones and then say, “Kid in the stroller is 2.”  That’s it.  Maybe somebody will look at you funny, but even that didn’t really happen.  Even though my 2 year old was so big he was in 5T clothes!"
u3pnpy,sixflags,notelcuhh,"Can confirm. Do this with my 2 girls each time. One is 2 years older than the other but they're the same size. Older is in bottom 10 percentile for age and younger is in top 90 percentile for age. Both walk in with strollers, show ID and they never bother to ask for the ones in the stroller."

Be happy/sad/worried, etc.  These comments from young people make me sad.  I’m not judging, please know… but it’s sad to hear individuals change facial expressions, how they sleep, etc to avoid a natural process. Of course, eat decently, don’t smoke, avoid sun bathing…. Moderate alcohol.  Take decent care of your skin….It’s just…. A bit disheartening at times.  Especially in the very young…… you’re all beautiful and have lovely, elastic skin!

It’s just a random filter, and I have pronounced cheekbones that I think it really picks up to give me a gaunt look. Regardless, don’t stress over it. I quit using the filter so as not to trigger me lol, as I get bad anxiety over aging.If it helps in general, I read a quote recently that said something alone the lines of “there’s nothing sadder than wasting youth by trying to run away from aging”We’re young now (especially you, 17 is so much younger than you even realize) so just enjoy being young and take the regular precautions. If we’re fortunate, we’re gonna age regardless, might as well savor our youth for now and live in the moment"
14ubqqt,SkincareAddiction,shitpresidente2,funny thing is I have very pronounced cheekbones but it makes my face sag so much and look fat. It's so bizarre. It really picks up on some of the lines you have on your face. Some lines I've had since I was young and has been the same for a long time - filter just uses that and exaggerates it.

1humcz4,SnarkAntiSexWork,ichunddergeist,"That’s absolutely ridiculous. I don’t work on OF because the amount of data they take from you to verify your age is more than I’m comfortable sharing. Any online SW (unless you build your own brand entirely using a bank account, which again, banks don’t just give out to minors who walk in on their own) has to go through multiple loops to verify their identity. They’re so confident lying because the anti-porn crowd will buy anything"
1humcz4,SnarkAntiSexWork,DebunkJunkiee,"This woman claims to be an ex-OnlyFans agency manager, but anyone familiar with the OnlyFans advice subreddits knows that these agencies are widely regarded as scams that exploit vulnerable people. In her own videos, she even admits to cold messaging creators to recruit them— a common tactic of these predatory agencies. Now, she speaks out against the industry on podcasts and other platforms, framing herself as someone who experienced its supposed “dangers.” But let’s be clear: she wasn’t working as a creator or genuinely part of the industry—she was allegedly part of a scam that failed. Now she’s capitalizing on this false narrative to discredit the industry. ✨Allegedly✨"
1humcz4,SnarkAntiSexWork,Chainmale001,"I AM on OnlyFan. I'll tell you now, their vetting process is intense. They require everything from State ID to verified email. They also require verification of every person associated with the account. I mentioned I'm married, even thought she has nothing to do with my account, and they wanted to verify HER. I do solo work. So saying OF doesn't vet is an outright lie."
1humcz4,SnarkAntiSexWork,XGrayson_DrakeX,I cannot believe someone would just straight up lie like that. (I mean I can but wow)People have gotten AI flags and weren't even breaking TOS. like a dildo or their own reflection was getting flagged as other people. They also heavily censor kink content and routinely take down couples content even if both people are tagged. I've had random shit taken down that had been up for YEARS without warning. Didn't even get an email about it. I got fed up and just abandoned mine.OF is a terrible platform but it's not for any of the reasons antis keep claiming.
1jl7jf8,SocialSecurity,Kappa351,NOt sure if thisis the problem but use to be you could only verify during business hours.. only they were bad at letting you know that..  from 2 years ago..
1jl7jf8,SocialSecurity,BeachBumm_,"No, this was online secondary verification during business hours."
1jl7jf8,SocialSecurity,momplaysbass,"I'm trying to get my mom's login.gov set up on SSA. After waiting two hours for it to verify her information we agreed to try it another day. We didn't even get as far as them asking to check telephone numbers.I did check on downdetector.com and it turned out they were having issues when we were doing this.If push comes to shove, she actually has an appointment on April 18th, and I told her she could ask them for help if we don't have it resolved by then."
1jl7jf8,SocialSecurity,Suzo8,"I just had this happen, but it worked for me. At the phone verification step, did you get the text from them and did you then click the link from that phone to verify the number before going back to the computer? And don't click anything else on the computer until it acknowledges that the phone was verified and moved on."
1jl7jf8,SocialSecurity,Fearless_Doughnut_19,"It’s new functionality that was released over the weekend. Depending how you previously authenticated your identity, this will happen. It’s basically a higher identity assurance level and consistent with updated NIST standards."
1jl7jf8,SocialSecurity,BeachBumm_,Well it's a flawed system if it doesn't provide an alternate means of validation such as by mail if the phone numbers aren't recognized or accepted because they are VOIP or Google Voice.
1jl7jf8,SocialSecurity,AdventurousBowler870,I had the exact same issue. I went through the ID.ME system and was verified by a live video feed agent. It was and is a pita.😳

1jl7jf8,SocialSecurity,DaffyDuckForPres,"I'm in Costa Rica trying to login to my SSA account and was prompted to verify my identity.  The process does not work for me.  The photo of my drivers license taken by the verification process has exposure set too high so the photo is washed out lacking detail.  But, over the weekend I was finally able to succeed being verified with Login.gov.  So I went to MySSA and attempted to login.  My identity, according to SSA, had not been identified.  I contacted Login.gov who told me simply to go back to SSA and tell them to use their alternate verification path.  What the hell is this even talking about and why doesn't the process work, period?All this government paranoia and haphazardly slicing and dicing departments and staff is ridiculous. Our fearless leader needs to understand not everyone is a criminal and that includes immigrants."

1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,Extension-College783,Thank you for bringing some sanity and clarity to this issue. I try not to get caught up in the news cycle about this and other things. Can things change...? Yes. But will they? I cannot spend my life in a state of worry.
1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,TX-911,"Good summary of current concerns I see all the time, especially the “bankrupt” one. I’m curious what the “calculated changes” are to get back to full funding status. I’ve seen a number of ideas like raising the cap, raising the retirement age, etc. Nothing currently proposed though since this topic will likely get kicked down the road until closer to the 2035 date. The next Trustees Report should be out next month which will no doubt energize the discussion."
1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,dadjeff1,It'll likely involve raising the FRA.
1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,gsquaredmarg,"What's the over-under on how far it gets kicked down the road? Unfortunately, I'm putting it in the next decade...which will make it even harder to solve."
1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,Neither-Complex5391,Theyve been sabotaging SS for years because they want people to have a negative view of it so they'll go along with the push to privatize it and dump the money in wall street.
1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,Cloudy_Automation,"The common meaning of bankruptcy is that an organization is unable to fulfill all its obligations. By that definition, Social Security and Medicare will be bankrupt. It doesn't mean it has no ability to pay its obligations, just not all of them. Bankruptcy is also a legal term for the judicial process for how creditors get paid, and I don't know of any of the bankruptcy chapters which would apply to the Social Security Administration.If no legislation is passed to fix this deficiency, it's unclear what SSA could do. Would it prioritize low benefit recipients? Disability? People claiming on their own record instead of their spouse's? Would people with independent retirement assets be penalized? SSA doesn't have the authority to make any of those choices. I can guarantee that no session of Congress wants to touch this, as there will be bigger losers and smaller losers, and they all vote. Some of the losers will be retirees, and some will be workers.Here's what Congress has to say:https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/RL33514By 2095, the amount SSA can pay for Social Security benefits will be down to 74%. Will our grandchildren want to pay into such a system?There is no way any tax cuts should be supported while leaving these problems unsolved. Talking points about privatization are also likely to be disastrous, as people who have paid into Social Security, but not yet retired, will want something, and that will come out of current retirees assets supporting monthly payments. And, if you complain about Social Security being taxed, you can bet a privatized Social Security would be partially taxed for everyone. The employer's contribution and interest were never taxes."
1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,ReddyKiloWit,"It's not the media spreading rumors, well, not entirely. It is statements made by certain people in the administration, or adjacent to, that are driving concerns. It's not comforting to hear someone supposedly in charge of changes describe Social Security, in an interview, only in terms pulled from myths and conspiracy theories. Or a cabinet secretary say if payments were stopped ONLY those committing fraud would complain. Or see a list of field offices that WILL close being distributed apparently from official sources.These aren't media exaggerations. And if they have no basis in reality the Administration isn't really doing much to make that clear. And reassurances from affected departments are no longer reassuring since they seem to lack authority on their own these days."
1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,puzzleahead,This is an excellent summary! Thank you.
1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,LoveCareThinkDo,"Oddly, my last two payments have shown up in my bank account about a day earlier than they normally would.Medicare had been sending me all kinds of stuff to make sure I know what I need to know to apply for benefits. If I take the defaults, then I don't even have to apply for anything. Even the ""Extra Help"" that I qualify for due to my extreme poverty, is automatically applied. They even sent me a whole huge book, letter sized paper, about ½"" thick, with all the benefits in large-ish font, and dozens of tables in the back listing comparisons of all the Advantage plans in my state.Sure, up until I actually get my payment, I am still terrified that it just won't show up, with no notice, reason, or recourse. But, I can't live my life in a perpetual state of terror, or then they win anyway."
1k33gb6,SocialSecurity,No-Clue-835,I have had great success working with the local SS office. If you call first thing in the morning you can get most questions answered.  They made sure I got all the new benefits I was due from the new Fairness Act- a monthly increase of $1600 within about a month after my phone appointment.
18r2syu,SomebodyMakeThis,JoeyJoeJoeJrShab,I don't understand how you're intending to determine someone's age. Ask them pop-culture quiz questions? How are you going to deal with the false negatives and false positives?
18r2syu,SomebodyMakeThis,cravecode,"With ChatGPT, Google, etc. this is unrealistic. There are some apps/sites that ask math problems to rule out very young children. I've seen them ask Siri to circumvent this. It ultimately comes down to ruling out who can read or not.A simple agree to ToS/Age is mostly enough for a CYA approach while not being cumbersome and risking abandonments.Much like the 'Accept-Language' header, I wish there was an HTTP header standardized that indicated the browser/device was in use by an underage user. This could be dangerous as well though as it could be used for targeted exploitation."
18r2syu,SomebodyMakeThis,Shaken_Earth,"The standardized HTTP header is a great idea. Although as you pointed out, it could be easily taken advantage of in order to target minors. I wonder if there are any good ways to minimize the chances of that being able to occur at all."
18r2syu,SomebodyMakeThis,whatever,"This was once done for a ""racy"" video game from the 80's named ""Leisure Suit Larry""The game would require you to answer several pop culture questions that ""only an adult could know.""The questions were also very US-centric in nature. Fortunately, they were paired with multiple choice answers, and you could just try again from the top indefinitely.The practical effect of all this is that it made me waste a few minutes whenever I wanted to start the game until I memorized every single answer. It did however teach me tiny bits of pointless trivia, and I have to believe that made it worth it somehow.This was, of course, a silly idea back then, just as yours is now. But it was considered fun and quirky when used to gatekeep a video game that marketed itself as adult-themed yet stayed far from anything porny.The idea of deploying a mechanism of that caliber to earnestly try to keep minors away from harmful content is just plain bad.The reason some sites ask ""are you an adult"" and trust your answer is because they don't care, they just don't want to get sued.Steam requires users to enter their ""birth date"" before showing some items on their store because rating agencies are requiring them to do that in order to not market rated games to the wrong audiences.The reason other sites require you to upload an ID and take a selfie with a piece of toast on your head is because applicable laws are literally forcing them to. They don't enjoy doing it, it makes them lose plenty of customers that would be old enough but just don't want to jump through the hoops, but it's not a negotiation. They either do what the jurisdictions they operate in require of them, or they can stop doing business there.Your proposal would be somewhere in the middle: Not actually stopping children determined to pass through, yet putting a sizable roadblock in front of adults, for the sake of a half-hearted attempt at keeping kids out. And of course not complying with age check regulations, which is the only reason any of this stuff exists in the first place."
18r2syu,SomebodyMakeThis,resetplz,Ask them to empty the dishwasher. If they refuse...
18r2syu,SomebodyMakeThis,KaelonR,"I think there's no way to reliably determine one's age without some form of ID, signed by a reputable third party (i.e. government) in order to prevent tampering. But going that route you run into a snake pit of privacy concerns and the fact that we don't have a central institution that has this kind of ID for everyone in the world. Good luck trying to implement this for one country, nevermind the majority of the planet.There are answers to the privacy concerns, but so far it's mostly been that companies can ask for ID if the law really, really needs them to 100% make sure someone is of adult age with other companies not being allowed to ask for ID at all because of privacy concerns. We ended with this in-between compromise for a lot of reasons and factors."
18r2syu,SomebodyMakeThis,bayareaburgerlover,this is doable if webcam is allowed. predict the age of person from the image
18r2syu,SomebodyMakeThis,AliceInCookies,"If presented as a mini gleam.io/contest, guess my age game sign in, where you link your socials like instagram, linkedin and youtube that have stricter age checks for it to scrape for birth date, graduation year, job periods and it might have some low viability."

1bezjtg,SubredditDrama,Evinceo,"I copied it for you OP:First off F them all. We have a generation of 25 yr old men with ED and skyrocketing divorces due to this filth. Their adds are always about cheating on your spouse and getting them as young as the law allows while pretending they’re younger. It’s all trash. Second off though, they openly admit here at their attempt to monopolize a market. “This law forces people to not click “yes” cause it’s such an exhaustive effort and instead go to third party websites that are smaller and not able to afford the expensive compliance measures that pornhub the conglomerate can”.They could care less about minor allegations and they have the money to cover anything they need up. They could care less that a user has to click one more time to see tits. No what they’re worried about is the general image and vibe that a user will receive. They will be reminded of the explicit nature, the underlying issue that’s lead to allegations, they’re afraid that the government and its governed will see the true evil of the industry and the related crimes that come from sex addiction which stems from regular pornography consumption. They’re afraid that this will snowball into a movement of accountability and actually wanting better for ourselves.Understand, it might require govt intervention to slow the damage of the porn industry and its ties with minor trafficking but this is not as simple as deterring from the use of a website. Men all across America suffer from the addiction and wish they weren’t as reliant as they are. Those same men are rejoicing at these restrictions and have some more hope. Porn addictions seriously addictive and carries with it a massive list of side effects both short and long term"

That way when their database gets hacked the perpetrators will have every user's id and photo plus all their profile and message content.

1cm6kjo,supremecourt,ItsTribeTimeNow,"From the perspective of a web developer, our rights to speech have been under extreme attack lately.  There really is no great way to check someone's ID online (and per Texas law, also not keep any records of it).  The whole law was written to make it virtually impossible to comply.  There is a false equivalence of adult bookstores and websites going on and those that make the argument that you need to check for id in the bookstores, why not online, are doing so in bad faith.If my web server is in another state and I have no nexus in Texas, why should I have to comply with an out of state law?  It's not as if I'm compelling individuals to access my web server.What's porn and what's not is also an issue.  If I were to preface all videos shown with quotes from Shakespeare, would I still have to check ID?  It's a hypothetical, but there are a million other hypotheticals one can come up with in regards to this idiotic law."
1cm6kjo,supremecourt,[deleted],"Agreed, it reminds me of the gun laws requiring technology that does not exist.Ends up being a de-facto ban on the civil right of firearm ownership."
1cm6kjo,supremecourt,Mexatt,There really is no great way to check someone's ID onlineThis makes me doubt this:From the perspective of a web developerOnline ID checking is a solved problem with a pre-existing commercial eco-system.
1cm6kjo,supremecourt,WorksInIT,"I think under current precedent, the Texas law is arguably unconstitutional. But it is distinctly different than the previous law that Congress had passed. It is more narrowly tailored and doesn't have the vagueness issues. So the court could rule that this law passes strict scrutiny while the other doesn't. I do think the 5th Circuit going with rational basis isn't going to be what SCOTUS does."
1cm6kjo,supremecourt,Urgullibl,"How they decide is ultimately an empirical question. My view is that obscenity doesn't enjoy 1A protection and that therefore these ID requirements are likely kosher and will stand.My view is also that it's stupid to regulate something like this at the State level and that Congress would be fully within their authority to do so Federally. But a law being stupid isn't the same as a law being unconstitutional, so this will be for Congress, not SCOTUS to fix."
1cm6kjo,supremecourt,Dave_A480,Internet porn doesn't reach the threshold of obscenity under current precedent vs-a-vs community standards.And there is no age exception to the 1A
1cm6kjo,supremecourt,sphuranto,"You have repeatedly maintained that the gated contentisobscenity, although that is not the general stance on the matter, following the confused trainwreck of jurisprudence, the failings of a shift to 'community standards', and converging precedents fromNAACP v. AlabamathroughACLU v. Reno."
1cm6kjo,supremecourt,Squirrel009,"We see only one answer and therefore only one way to read Ashcroft II consistently with Ginsberg: Ashcroft II did not rule on the appropriate tier of scrutiny for COPA.  It merely ruled on the issue the parties presented: whether COPA would survive strict scrutiny.  Indeed, the petitioner’s brief in Ashcroft II made two claims:...In other words, the petitioners did not challenge the applicable standard of review. Because that is not a jurisdictional argument, the Court did not have to correct them sua sponte.There are 3 levels if scrutiny when the courts look at a violation of constitutional rights: rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny. Those range first to last, easy to hard.They're subjective and you can't really reduce it to math but rational basis generally means the government wins unless what they're doing is insanely stupid and or hateful. Strict scrutiny means the government is going to have a heck of a time proving that it's incredibly important they have this law and there's no other way they can accomplish their important goal they wrote it for.Aschroft lead the lower court and those who agree with the ACLU and others that this case should hinge on strict scrutiny - meaning Texas should be held to an incredibly high standard when explaining why this law is incredibly important and there isn't any less restrictive way for them to do it.The 5th circuit disagrees and think they should use rational basis - which is only technically not the same as saying Texas wins good bye. Rational basis is generally that easy.What's weird about that decision and has the aclu and others upset is that the Fifth Circuit decided that the supreme court in ashcroft used the wrong kind of review. This is very strange because the lower court had absolutely no authority to tell the supreme court they're wrong on a matter of law. They try to get out of this insane departure from the law by saying the supreme court wasn't technically wrong, they just weren't technically required to use the right standard because the appelant didn't ask them to.The 5th circuit is infamous for crazy cases like this that completely ignore precedent and do unpredictable things like this - it's part of why you see Texas involved in high profile cases so much.As for scotus, they aren't required and often don't comment when they turn down injunctions like the one requested here. It likely means a majority of the court is at least moderately curious about this law being constitutional and agreeing with the Fifth Circuit.More pessimistic court watchers would likely tell you that this court is very conservative and is intentionally letting the law stand despite knowing it isn't constitutional for political reasons - like Texas abortion bounty hunter law that got a bunch of buzz prior to the Dobbs decision overturning Roe.It may be a sign they're going to overturn ascroft, or in my opinion they'll do a trick this court likes to do sometimes where they pretend they aren't overturning it while making a ruling inconsistent with the decision - similar to how the 5th circuit basically overruled the supreme court but said technically they didn't despite it being obvious the results sure look like they did."
1cm6kjo,supremecourt,JudgeWhoOverrules,"IMHO I believe this law would pass even strict scrutiny because it's been long held that the government has an inherent interest in protecting children from sexual material offline (strip clubs, adult magazines, porn theaters) with age-gating upheld many times, as it is the most narrowly tailored method to accomplish it."
17o9suj,SwagBucks,FightmeLuigibestgirl,You can get surveys for teenagers. You should have used your actual age. You might get banned via surveys and unable to cash out if you use different information.

17o9suj,SwagBucks,buppywins,"Jail.Jk, no, you might lose the ability to continue doing surveys though.Not condoning rule breaking, but If a teen was gonna lie about their age, they could at least pretend to be their own parent, and be able to qualify for all the surveys which ask if there’s kids in the home. Theoretically speaking of course."
17o9suj,SwagBucks,MadAsianDood,"How about game offers? I hear that they usually send the ID verification email when you send a support request, usually for pending issues. THEN what do I do? Also, then, is there a way I can change my age or is it too late?"
17o9suj,SwagBucks,blinkdmb,When you cash out your points just make sure you put the birthday that you put to sign up my son did it before he was 18 and when he went to cash out he used his birthday and they banned him and didn't give him his points

I alternated between 2 zip codes I move back and forth between IRL and had a warning pop up that I've given some inconsistent answers and might lose access to surveys.

Back when the ban was givem, I had argued against the ban being based on a vague pair of questions that I answered with conflicting answers bc both were true."
qpib2t,SwipeHelper,EGSLLC,Just forget and create new tinder account. Ive used dating zest tinder service to create new account.

qpib2t,SwipeHelper,martint8,"Guys I need your help, my Tinder Account asks for verification but I don’t want to verify it I need to delete it. I tried deleting the app and I keep getting the same message. What can I do?"
rihdol,SwipeHelper,CeaselessDuchess,You need to create new account. Use DatingZest Tinder service to get back again on it. It worked for me
rihdol,SwipeHelper,corsega,"Likely you didn't do a hard reset, so they were able to link your old account."
rihdol,SwipeHelper,justareddituser2021,It's also entirely possible that either 1) people reported a profile with no photos of a person or 2) Tinder uses some sort of very simple AI to periodically flag accounts that don't seem to have any photos of people.
rihdol,SwipeHelper,Nvidos,Just wanted to give some update for those who need it. So I waited like 12 hours or less and was able to use my account for 15 minutes before It got locked again and it force me to verify. So I logged in through Firefox and was able to manage and delete my account.And no.. I didn't catfish or anything bad. But I guess I got flagged out on this verification because this verification happened after I created a new second identity browser through the sphere browser.. Which changed my ip to another location. It was right after that I got this issue to be forced to verify. I have read read threads here from people moving to another city and then the same thing happens to theme.I don't want to verify based on what I have read. But I am not sure if things have changed today . Is a verification only to state that you are a human these days or does it also store other info which makes it even more difficult to banned users to use it after you verified? Any verified banned user's here who have experimented?
xla9is,SwipeHelper,justareddituser2021,"Photo recognition and facial recognition are two very different things. The way you ran this test, there's no way to tell whether they're using photo recognition or facial recognition.Photo recognition is based on image hashing, which is specifically built to get around things like cropping and other photo manipulation. As others have pointed out, there's some evidence that Hinge has at least experimented with this technology. It's reasonable to assume that other Match Group apps have as well.Facial recognition is based on facial geometry. There are very strict laws about collecting, retaining, and using this data in many jurisdictions."
xla9is,SwipeHelper,0shocklink,"I see this a lot but they actually don’t need to retain any of your images. Images like all forms of digital data can be represented as a hash i.e image1 -> abc123z. Now let’s say you change the image, but your still in it. The way the hashing function works is that it even if you change the image a lot, if there is something present that is similar (your face) the hash is still relatively similar i.e image2 -> abc123b. In essence they can tell it’s the same person even though it’s a different image. So they just store that instead of your image since there’s no need for it."
xla9is,SwipeHelper,HalloMolli,"Well, if it was that easy then how is the (hard) reset guide supposed to work? Doesn't make sense to me to go through all of this if everything they need to do is is to compare your hash IDs (from photos) with each other in order to identify you regardless."
xla9is,SwipeHelper,Pgk137,Does hinge do this too?? I was banned and want to get back on but idk if they use facial recognition or would recognize my pics
xla9is,SwipeHelper,actual__literature,"This is correct.Here is Okcupid talking about their hash algorithm. Since Match owns OKC, Tinder, Hinge etc then it isn’t a stretch to assume they use similar hash functionshttps://tech.okcupid.com/evaluating-perceptual-image-hashes-at-okcupid-e98a3e74aa3aI tested it against Fawkes and Fawkes doesn’t change the photo of the hash. Nor does changing the photos dimensions, flips, adding colors to it etc"
xla9is,SwipeHelper,Face-Financial,Bro you’re missing stepsI’ve literally run experiments where I have 5 active face verified accounts with the same pool of previously banned images running all at the same exact time all getting varying degrees of matches
xla9is,SwipeHelper,Skydome12,I normally wouldn't have a problem with this since if you're getting banned you've done something wrong but sadly we know for a fact tinder bans people for absolutely no reason so i'm actually against this since it actually depletes your online dating chances and getting to know people irl is a bit tricky these days since a lot of shit has moved online.There really really REALLY needs to be some sort of investigation into match group since we know they charge people differently based on age which is agist we know they make men pay more for services vs women which surely should be a case for sexism/discrimination.
xla9is,SwipeHelper,justareddituser2021,"There really really REALLY needs to be some sort of investigation into match group since we know they charge people differently based on age which is agist we know they make men pay more for services vs women which surely should be a case for sexism/discrimination.Charging different prices based on age is perfectly legal in the US at the federal level. It may be illegal in certain states and localities, but that's not common.That's why it's legal for movie theaters, restaurants, etc. to offer senior discounts. Tinder's junior discount was no different legally. They can charge less to younger users, just like movie theaters can charge less for younger viewers or buffets can charge less for younger diners.You might not like it, but it's perfectly legal.Also, they don't make men pay more in the US.

13ijq03,technology,ioncloud9,I guess “personal responsibility” and actual parenting isn’t the job of parents anymore when it comes to online porn. Love it when the party of personal responsibility and “freedom” makes these decisions for you.
13ijq03,technology,Hrmbee,"FTA:Government agencies, private companies, and academic researchers have spent years seeking a way to solve the thorny question of how to check internet users’ ages without the risk of revealing intimate information about their online lives. But after all that time, privacy and civil liberties advocates still aren’t convinced the government is ready for the challenge.“When you have so many proposals floating around, it’s hard to ensure that everything is constitutionally sound and actually effective for kids,” Cody Venzke, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), tells The Verge. “Because it’s so difficult to identify who’s a kid online, it’s going to prevent adults from accessing content online as well.”...As pointed out by CNIL’s report on various online age verification options, all these methods have serious flaws. CNIL notes that identifying someone’s age with a credit card would be relatively easy since the security infrastructure is already there for online payments. But some adult users — especially those with lower incomes — may not have a card, which would seriously limit their ability to access online services. The same goes for verification methods using government-issued IDs. Children can also snap up a card that’s lying around the house to verify their age.Similarly, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has expressed concerns about online age verification. In a report it updated in March, the US legislature’s in-house research institute found that many kids aged 16 to 19 might not have a government-issued ID, such as a driver’s license, that they can use to verify their age online. While it says kids could use their student ID instead, it notes that they may be easier to fake than a government-issued ID. The CRS isn’t totally on board with relying on a national digital ID system for online age verification either, as it could “raise privacy and security concerns.”...To privacy and civil liberties advocates, none of these solutions are ideal. Venzke tells The Verge that implementing age verification systems encourages a system that collects our data and could pave the way for more surveillance in the future. “Bills that are trying to establish inferences about how old you are or who you are based on that already existing capitalistic surveillance, are just threatening to legitimize that surveillance,” Venzke says. “As we think about kids’ online safety, we need to do so in a way that doesn’t enshrine and legitimize this very surveillance regime that we’re trying to push back on.”The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, similarly argues that all age verification solutions are “surveillance systems” that will “lead us further towards an internet where our private data is collected and sold by default.”Even some strong supporters of child safety bills have expressed concerns about making age verification part of them. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), one of the backers of the Kids Online Safety Act, objected to the idea in a call with reporters earlier this month. In a statement, he tells The Verge that “age verification would require either a national database or a goldmine of private information on millions of kids in Big Tech’s hands” and that “the potential for exploitation and misuse would be huge.” (Despite this, the EFF believes that KOSA’s requirements would inevitably result in age verification mandates anyway.)...Some proponents of online safety laws say they’re no different than having to hand over an ID to purchase alcohol. “We have agreed as a society not to let a 15-year-old go to a bar or a strip club,” said Laurie Schlegel, the legislator behind Louisiana’s age restriction law, after its passage. “The same protections should be in place online.” But the comparison misses vastly different implications for free speech and privacy. “When we think about bars or ordering alcohol at a restaurant, we just assume that you can hand an ID to a bouncer or a waiter, they’ll hand it back, and that’s the end of it,” Venzke adds. “Problem is, there’s no infrastructure on the internet right now to [implement age verification] in a safe, secure, private way that doesn’t chill people’s ability to get to constitutionally protected speech.”This tension between privacy and verifying part of ones identity (in this case, age) has been ongoing for years, but now that the infrastructure is in place to implement large-scale and widespread tracking, that infrastructure is also unfortunately being pressed into use for these purposes. It would be good to figure out how (if possible) we can create a way to verify a part of someone's identification, in a trustless system, without revealing too much about the rest of their identity. Likely a successful solution will bridge both technical as well as social approaches. Less successful approaches will likely rely strictly on available technologies and solutions."

At no cost (outside setup and hardware).You don't even have to setup hardware and setup stuff, there is free DNS services you can just plop the IP into the devices, and you're good to go.

There is this bit at the end of the article that suggests this may be the case:foreigners who visit France and want to access pornographic content must open an account on FranceConnectIt sounds as only requests from France would be subject to the verification, which means that anybody that can figure out how to use a proxy doesn't need to go through FranceConnect.So, great idea, shame that it can be bypassed."

By the way, in South Korea, age verification via mobile phone is used for adult content such as safe search, and it doesn't seem to be a major problem.

1jpm70o,technology,weasol12,Could have interesting implications on the porn age verification laws sprouting up if those are ever challenged.
1jz6p8y,technology,gordonjames62,"This is a big deal.Any time you give people the opportunity to access your ID, you give them the opportunity to manipulate your ID and use it for their purposes which may not be legal or in your best interest.  Also consider how many websites have had data breaches where user data is now for sale on the dark web.I strongly oppose porn, but using the existence of porn sites as an excuse to track Internet users and access their government ID is a mistake.Here is the direction I think it will go.Require ""age verification"" for pornRequire ""age verification""  for social media accounts (we must protect the children)require age verification for streaming mediaAll these will be part of the trend towards a digital ID that allows tracking at every point on the web.this is a bad idea at every pointIt is my job as a parent to monitor my minor kids internet use.I do not trust government policy to parent my kids."

It would require that every teenager here is up to date with the latest trends etc..., which might not be the case for some teenagers  (like me), and prevent us from interacting here.And sorry, but I don't have any idea on how to have a perfect identification system to prevent pedos from posting here"

18hu873,TheoryOfReddit,[deleted],"Welcome to social media.You'll find that points youve mentioned here can be found on every platform on the internet.You'll also find that most users do not want to provide private information and for good reason. This info gets leaked on a regular basis. It's leaked from bad actors inside the company, accidently, and by users with malicious intent. There are entire marketplaces for this info."
18hu873,TheoryOfReddit,17291,"I believe that Reddit should require the user to verify (credit/debit card, passport, birth certificate, driving licence, etc) that they are over the age of 18.Sounds like a privacy disaster waiting to happen"
18hu873,TheoryOfReddit,GaryNOVA,OP is the fun police
18hu873,TheoryOfReddit,devperez,"Would you make all social media 18+? Or just Reddit? They all have these same issues, so I'm curious as to how Reddit is different here."
18hu873,TheoryOfReddit,dissenting_adult,"In theory, I strongly agree with you.In practice, I don't know how to overcome the two very strong difficultles:Privacy and security - see the other commentsApathy - the Reddit owners and admins just don't care; they just want volume from anyone and everyone.Something similar is done on some subreddits.r/AskDocsandr/Ask_Lawyershave rules requiring that commenters submit evidence of their credentials. I don't know how, or if, the mods handling that evidence keep it secure.Someday, someone will figure out how to securely verify the identity of posters, and start another social platform similar to Reddit.  When they do, and it gains some traction, I for one will quickly drop Reddit for such a platform."
18hu873,TheoryOfReddit,AChickenInAHole,Debit cards aren't accepted for age verification by Google because plenty of teenagers have them.
18hu873,TheoryOfReddit,DharmaPolice,"Will someone please think of the children!Also, this is not going to happen (unless enforced by law) since it would crash Reddit's user base. Not because everyone is under 18 but a lot of people don't want to verify their age by giving documents over.Besides:Gore/etc - can be found on the wider internet and I'm skeptical it is that harmful.Grooming - is there any evidence this is happening? Would seem to apply to any site where there is messaging. You could always disable PMs for unverified users if this were a serious danger (it isn't).Bullying. Isolated insults from across the world are not bullying. Unlike Facebook or TikTok your identity is not tied to your account so if someone insults you just create a new account. Again, I'm skeptical this is an issue - kids need to be able to cope with being insulted.Radicalisation. This is happening via YouTube and TikTok more than here. And even if you don't allow them to signup they can still read comments unless you hide the site from Google (crushing a huge part of Reddit's value).Misinformation. Trying to hide information from people doesn't work. And is a larger problem elsewhere.Overall this all sounds like a classic moral panic driven by authoritarianism. Younger children should be supervised with internet usage generally. Older children / teenagers can cope with Reddit which is pretty tame overall.And if you ban them here they'll just use 4chan which is many times worse."
18hu873,TheoryOfReddit,Ayjayz,Reddit is 18+. Parents shouldn't let their kids on here.It's not something for Reddit or anyone but the parents to worry about.
18hu873,TheoryOfReddit,MyThrowaway1890,"I hate this argument so much. Most parents are objectively not the best. It’s impossible to actually regulate what your child is looking at. We wouldn’t say “Let’s not help drug addicted teens, it’s their parent’s responsibility.”"

Worth mentioning if you’re in a similar boat."
198ytlw,Tiktokhelp,ktsurly,"This worked for me too! I signed up for TikTok shop yesterday late afternoon, uploaded my driver's license, and got an email right away saying my TikTok shop was approved. Then I tried to link my shop account to my new TikTok account, but I kept getting the message about needing to complete identity verification. I messed with it for an hour before getting frustrated and giving up.I found this thread a few minutes ago and checked my TikTok notifications and I had a notification that just showed up about 10 minutes ago--which was about16 hoursafter I started this process. The notification looked exactly like it did in the screen shot above ^^When I clicked on that notification, I was taken to a page where I had to enter my full legal name, address, and last 4 of my SSN. I got a message saying identify verification was complete, so then I followed these steps:went back into TikTok shop seller central on my laptopclicked on the store icon in the top right corner --> My Account --> linked accounts. The page shows a QR code to scanopened the TikTok app on my phone with the new account openclick the Profile icon (bottom right corner)click the 3 lines (top right corner)choose ""My QR code"" optionclick the little square icon in the top right corner that looks like a box with a line through the middlescan the QR code on my laptop screenconfirm I want to link the accountAnd then I could see my new TikTok account in the linked accounts section of seller central.

1hwc2oc,Tiktokhelp,haileighj,This happened to me today. Submitted my id and selfie 9 hours ago and still don't have my account fixed yet. Felt weird doing it but I just want my account back. Fucking dumb.

1hx9itu,Tiktokhelp,kgalvan,"Dude i just got this today, like id rather not upload my ID or CC to it?? Wtf so weird."
1hx9itu,Tiktokhelp,domiii010,BRO THEY DIDNT ACCEPT MY APPEAL BOTH ID AND CREDIT CARD IDK WHAT TO DO
1hx9itu,Tiktokhelp,flower_girl05,i got the exact same thing just 2 days ago. i did end up doing the ID option which idk how i feel about that now considering it’s been almost 24 hours and my account has yet to change. i’ll update if anything but this has been super annoying considering the ban soon 🥲
1hx9itu,Tiktokhelp,AdEquivalent8173,they did this to me yesterday and did not approve the credit card and im still waiting for the id appeal results. I have had the app since 2019 and i am in my early 20s so i have no idea why they sent me this now
1hx9itu,Tiktokhelp,Kaleidoscopic_ness,i’ve tried signing up to tiktok for the first time and am of age but it just says i’m not eligible and i even tried saying i was born in 2000 and it just denies me
1hx9itu,Tiktokhelp,Infinite_Monitor345,I just had this happen to me. I am actually so confused. Did it make you put in a cardholder name when you put in your appeal with giftcard?

1ij42jc,Tiktokhelp,Jazzlike_Trainer2211,"I would say so. I just had issues getting my age verified to go live/ make money, I put in the correct age when signing up- but when I went to verify it like got stuck in limbo for a while. Finally got it sorted out but had to submit a ton of support tickets and emails to do so. So I’ve done the process twice.When you do the verification for it & want to make money on TT they require you scan in your drivers license or photo ID (and I think they give other options like passport etc). They also had me hold up my license to my face with a code written on a piece of paper and take a selfie to submit with it all.They seem to be kind of strict on it- or at least that’s my experience.Here is a very generic email response I got from them talking about age verification.Maybe using that link in the email can help you. Best of luck!"
1ij42jc,Tiktokhelp,Logical_Year_7545,"Thanks, I just don't understand if there will be a problem with the year - I put older, even though I'm already 18 years old, I didn't think about it, but my birthdate is my birthdate, is it worth doing something about it at all or is it much easier to post videos to a new account? what do you think?"

So weird"
txmel3,Tiktokhelp,Badass_British,did you ever fix it? my account is having the same issue right now 😭
txmel3,Tiktokhelp,CercleRouge,Mine is too... have a video that's popping off and suddenly a bunch of people commenting in a previous video saying they can no longer see the new one. Super frustrating.
txmel3,Tiktokhelp,Temporary-Tati,This just happened to me maybe two days ago and out of know where It just started saying age protected I’ve gone through the entire TikTok app and I cannot figure out how to take it off!?

You’re gonna have to provide a form of identification that shows you’re 16+ and you’re gonna have to take a picture with it with your face while holding it and also you’re gonna have to write a code on a paper big and hold it showing your face after that you should gain your account right away (idk if it takes a while but for me I got it back once I submitted those 2)"

But he was three!My kids are also chatty and love to correct me when I’m wrong so I’m sure if I lied to a cashier and my kid overheard me he would loudly correct me and tell them his actual age, so I really want to avoid that 🤣"

As the museum counter lady said “But madam, he has a beard! He looks well over 20.” She replied:”He does. It happened very young to him.

1d8795v,TotalWireless,PartyRutabaga168,"Thanks for your reply, I actually got it to work but ran into another issue 😭A few hours before your post I did almost exactly what you suggested, desktop to phone and return to desktop to finish. It gave me problems the first couple times when doing that but then I got it to work by doing the entire document submission and selfie in warp speed, like 10-15 seconds.BUT.. when I tried to purchase the phones it gives an error message on the final step of checkout ""Alert - We Apologize, but we cannot process your transaction at this time, please try again later or call us at 1-866-xxx-xxxx""So it won't let me pay for the phones now.. even though the number check and identity verification were successful.

Hopefully someone replies back to me with a workaround.I don't know if you're familiar with the full porting/activation process but I have a quick question if you have a moment.Right now they have some deals where porting is required, but I was wondering how long after receiving the phone in the mail do you have to complete the porting/activation?I ask because I still have 25 days on my current carrier's plan but want to buy one of these phones before the deal expires. So I was hoping I could do the verification and buy the plan and phone now but not activate/port out for another 20 days. Is that possible?Thx again"

1d8795v,TotalWireless,PartyRutabaga168,Thanks for the reply. I think you're allowed two phones per account.. so I'm thinking that's why you didn't have to verify again.What device and browser did you use to do the verification? I was able to get the verification to work but now it gives an error message at checkout 😂

13s6fq4,travel,pdebarra,It's not Kiwi. It's Ryanair. A travel agent was telling me about it the other day. They just hate people booking through third parties for some reason.
13s6fq4,travel,Pink_CzLady,It’s not kiwi. Not that I recommend booking through third parties. I just got the same email last night and I booked on Ryanair app.  It’s a known problem. You can’t escape it
13s6fq4,travel,Paintingsosmooth,"If you make an account, not through those links, but directly with Ryanair then you can find yourself on that flight after by typing in your surname and probably a number that kiwi will have given you on your booking receipt."

I had booked with Last Minute for Ryanair flights, and during the referral check-in, I was hit with the Ryanair verification page. It turned out to be because of the way they formatted the names. Here's how to find out what is correct:On your last minute ""Remember to check in for your xxx"" email, find their generated email looks something likejohn7@leo.doe(dot)bookingease(dot)xxxCopy it from that email. exampleFirst name and surname: John LoeLast: doeMine had spaces instead of hyphens, etc.I hope this helped."

1i4qi7g,travel,No-Ad8919,"Apparently, it was just that some venues have never seen a Swedish drivers license, so they didn't know what to do with it to verify my age and didn't feel comfortable with giving me alcohol because of that, I think.And I don't actually have a Swedish national ID card, but it's definitely something I should look into getting, just for safety sake at this point. You never know when it could be useful to have.It seems that a physical passport is the only 100% guarantee to work everywhere, but you're saying that showing my Swedish driver license should work too in USA? Is it like a 50% chance they would accept it att different venues or what is it like? I'm just curious at this point, probably just have to suck it up for now and just wait until I get back to Sweden and get a new passport, and next time I come to USA I will have that passport in my new passport holder with AirTag tracker so I don't lose it accidentally"
1i4qi7g,travel,lirarebelle,Is a regular ID not mandatory in Sweden? What do Swedes who don't have a license do? Do they carry their passport all the time?

1chcsr1,Twitter,luneskeine,"hello, i help run a number of twitter accounts for work, and was recently forced to add a birthday for all of these.i thought all i had to do was to put in the year that the organisation was founded, but didn't realise that twitter is now imposing this 13 years of age policy at the time of creation. i am obviously above the age of 13, but not all these organisations are, so i thought i would use my year of birth instead. while this worked on one account, it didn't on another because i wasn't 13 when the account was created and as a result i got locked out. i've looked through all the relevant guides as well as the email i was sent about the lock and all that's done is led me to a bunch of dead links. i really need this account running again because it's a work account and all this has done is made today a lot harder than it has to be.any advice or any similar experiences you may have had with this would be greatly appreciated, thank you!"

There are so many more significant problems that could be solved by that technology.They’re not.

1k0gzve,unitedkingdom,Substantial-Newt7809,"Just to be clear, this is an optional Discord thing to ""verify"" your account as belonging to an adult. If you don't care about it, you can ignore it. I certainly will be."
1k0gzve,unitedkingdom,WebDevWarrior,"I was involved in digital policy at the drafting of the Online Safety Act and had a lot of harsh words with individuals regarding the bill and the gaping holes with it and the dangers it posted to peoples safety and rights (which lead to me getting toxic abuse from people in childrens charities like Save the Children, Barnardos and civil servants working for both Labour and the tories).This is what will enevitably happen (based on my 20+ years experience in the tech sector)...Online Privacy Act mandates all businesses with interactions (example Discord) have to have your government mandated ID to prove you're ""of age"" to view potentually adult material (to cover themselves legally) - assuming they don't use a third-party platform (which has its own massive list of compliance risks eg GDPR, etc).At some stage, one of the platforms hosting your government ID will be breached (no system is unhackable), see 23&Me as a precautionary tale where they got breached, their business failed, and everyones DNA is now at risk of public exposure or resale for bad purposes. Or a rogue employee with high level access could make off with the data (corporate theft).Criminals will use this information to go on an international spree of impersonation scams (possibly using AI where it can be used to deepfake) as people aren't sacred with their privacy and incidents of identity theft (and the inevitable hijacked bank accounts, loans taken out in peoples names, possibly even transfer of home ownership etc) are both possible and on the rise.There will be a lot of finger pointing from politicians blaming each other. Police won't be able todo fuck all because it will mostly be triggered from outside UK borders (where they can't be prosecuted) - like those annoying scam emails, texts, and phone calls. And the charities who fucked everyone over by bankrolling the law to make everyone hand their data over to foreign billionaires ""cause children"" will disclaim any liability as they will say its not up to them to fix problems, just point them out (which is a cop out and BS)."

You can sign legal contracts, live on your own, vote, join the military, etc. if you are not legally a full adult in your country then you are underage and not allowed to work or get paid through Upwork. You can be honest with them and let them know that you’d like to hold identification for one month, when you’ll be 18. Don’t, under any circumstances, try to fake it by using someone else’s if or having someone else verify for you. They would burn your account permanently."

Obviously, they suspended my account but only temporarily. As soon as you turn 18, submit the proper verification, and your account will be unbanned. I'm still happily freelancing.The only thing that happens to your account during temporary suspension is that all your proposals are automatically withdrawn. Basically you lose your connects."

1f6s6ua,vending,pdxtrader,How does it do the age verification through scanning driver's license?
1f6s6ua,vending,trustworthysauce,Just saw this comment from /u/drahoffman.Looks like you can get them at customvending.com
1f6s6ua,vending,Spare-Month-2501,"I’ve seen ones that use a swipe method, but it seems like it can only verify for 18+ and not a custom number or 21+Others use a scanning bed and a camera that compares your face to the ID being used. Seems the most popular are vape machines but I need a refrigerated drink machine.Guess my biggest problem here is sourcing one locally and short term"
1fel6eb,vending,VendingGuyEthan,"Age verification is key, especially with vape products. In Texas, you’ll need to make sure that the machine isn’t accessible to underage customers, which can be done with ID checks. I’ve been in the vape vending business for years and have dealt with these laws, so feel free to reach out if you need help figuring it out!"
1fel6eb,vending,costacomo,Hey there . Check out annovend.com they are US based and their machines come with age verification software. Well priced too. I’ve bought 2 machines from them and super happy.
1fel6eb,vending,[deleted],N/A
1fel6eb,vending,trustworthysauce,"Looked those up. The machines look cool, but I wasn't ready to give all my info and request a quote. What is the typical price range for a basic machine?Thanks for the suggestion"
1fel6eb,vending,Additional_Pain_812,So l have 18 machines and I think I created the thread you were taking about. You woudint be able to do the hotel idea because it has to be in a place that serves liquor.From what I understand with my network of vape vendors there are many people who “break the law” in Texas and put vape machines in under 21 accessible bars/clubs and never see or face any repercussions. So it’s kinda up to you whether you want to do it or not.If it’s in 21+ locations you don’t need Age Verification and you can profit up to $1000 a month off of it. If it’s under 21 you’d want the Age Verification  just to be safe age verification spots can be just as lucrative as 21+ locations.Please do not make the mistake of buying a Chinese vape machine or convert just a normal glass front snack machine into a vape machine. I can talk about why you wouldn’t want to do that later. Just Pm me l can even hop on call and explain everything in depth if you’d like.
1fel6eb,vending,trustworthysauce,Awesome. Thanks for the information and the offer. I may reach out if I go farther down the vape path. One of the websites I was on was selling snack machines by saying they could be used to sell vapes and CBD products in the machine's product description. I would be interested in why that is not a recommended solution. Really appreciate the response.
1fel6eb,vending,Original-Address-611,Where are you in Texas
1fel6eb,vending,trustworthysauce,"Near Austin, but not in Austin. I have looked into county and city ordinances, but have not found any about tobacco or CBD vending"
1fel6eb,vending,Appropriate_Tea_7837,"Been thinking the same in Illinois tho. Similar laws too from what I read. Bars is definitely on the radar, but prior to a bar being a bar they’re usually a grill that allows under 21. So that would be a hurdle. But in Illinois every bar has slots that need to be monitored over 21. But also strip clubs!"
1go1x2y,vending,Donny_GER,"How do you check the age on age verification products then, if you can purchase it cash ?!Nayax itself does not have age verfication !on the other hand, in the product settings is a button, where you activate age verification check, but this worked only in austria for a very specific payment method, as far as I am aware."
1go1x2y,vending,EndevorVending,Have you tried reaching out to the manufacturer on this? Nayax typically does not allow purchase of age restricted products with a credit card. This is due to restrictions with the card brands.
1go1x2y,vending,Additional_Pain_812,What products are you selling ?

And could it have anything to do with this fentanyl issue with Trump under the guise of trying to reduce the odds of distributing it to remote areas by train?The other reason could be because Via is getting abused by persons claiming discounts (such as Indigenous, Canadian Military, CAA) which they don't qualify for, by using someone else's ID or discount code and instead of singling-out people on the train, they are avoiding issues by making it a blanket policy?This change requires a lot of work for the on-train crew.

Even in business class when they specifically call for you to board you often have to slalom through the line of people who walked up to the person checking and then managed to forget they had to show a ticket.If they're checking on board instead then it's a lot of extra workload on the crew as they're already busy with preparing to depart.And I assume they have to check everyone before departing otherwise there's no use, so that's not going to help leaving on time."

11ts2m4,virtualreality,CindyTroll,"Yes and no. I was in an 18+ room with drunk college bros yelling at each other. I know they were over 21, but it was absolute chaos. They'd start yelling at anyone who wanted to have any input. Threatening to kick people who looked at them,  etc.. It was a dumpster fire, and even the screeching kids in Gorilla Tag were a welcome respite after that. I think it's more about heavy moderation than age verification. TL:DR Adults can be just as childish. IMO, kicking out the toxic people is more effective."

18linpy,virtualreality,Ryuuzen,It sounds like a security measure for something. Maybe the information on the account seemed too fake?
18linpy,virtualreality,JorgTheElder,"An account for a 13 year old should be tied to the another account managed by an adult. Period.In my opinion Meta should make anyone under 18 have their account approved by someone over 18 because of the legal risks.Those under 18 in the US cannot even legally accept the terms of a contract so their accounts should be tied to someone that is not a minor that takes legal responsibility for them.https://www.upcounsel.com/contracts-signed-by-minors#google_vignetteContracts signed by minors, those under the age of 18, do not have the same legal status as contracts signed by adults because minors are seen as not having the same legal understanding as adults. Because of that, when minors sign contracts, the contract is not valid, and minors are under no obligation to honor that contract. There are exceptions, which include contracts for food, lodging, medicine, and other necessities. Otherwise, minors are required to have a parent or guardian to give consent in order for the contract to be legally binding.Because of this, store purchases and such should benotallowed by any account tied to a minor that is not also tied to an adult."

18linpy,virtualreality,frankvagabond303,"Sounds like your crotch goblin was being a little shit in VR and got reported to many times for saying the N word and/or being annoying in a place where children are not welome.Meta knows children don't have IDs, and parents aren't gonna upload their birth certificate.

18linpy,virtualreality,zeddyzed,"For people to avoid this issue, how did you create his account?  Did you enter his underage birthdate or an adult birthdate?You said he hasn't even started using the headset yet, how do you think Meta knows he was underage?Did you try creating a child account instead?"
18linpy,virtualreality,Crafty_Individual_47,They have absolutely no right to do this. Also they say on another page they do not save any information and another one they say they save it on encrypted format. Also they apply same rules no matter if you are on EU or in US when completely different laws apply. Would you trust a company whos business model is to collect as much information about an individual as they can and use this to target ads.
18linpy,virtualreality,Metaismean,I’ve had the same problem but Ik how to fix it I’ve emailed meta support team and they told me how to fix without a id you can do it as long as your  email is not linked with facebook or instagram
1et1ydr,virtualreality,JorgTheElder,"Yea, they are usingtricksto see if you committed fraud when you signed up for a Meta account.Locking your account does not brick your headset, you can just factory reset it and make a new Meta account.They have laws they have to follow that require them to know the age of their customers, if you don't like that, don't be a customer.I don't live in the USA or anywhere else where age confirmation is required by the law, so can't be that in my case. Even if it is, I gave those details during signup.I don't believe that is true at all. Pretty much every country has added laws to protect underage kids, and those laws require online services to know the age of their customers. They also sell age restricted software on the Quest store which again, requires them to know the ages of their customers."
1et1ydr,virtualreality,WyrdHarper,"Plenty of services require regular age confirmation checks, too. I have to enter it into steam every time I want to look at certain games, for example.And with states/countries being more aggressive about age laws when it comes to device use (a good thing) to protect children, you’re going to see it more and more."
1et1ydr,virtualreality,No-Marionberry-772,"The cope in the face of this issue is something else.The laws don't require them to know the age of their users.The law requires them to not collect data on minors, and thats a    EXTREMELY different requirement.They use that requirement as a shield to confuse users, like you, into believing that meta has no choice here, but they do.They have a choice to allow users to opt in to data collection. They have a choice to not force every user to pay for using their hardware both upon purchase, and every time the users use it.They don't care about those choices, because they care about turning you into a product and using you for profit, and they are not allowed to do that with minors.Stop bending the situation and acting like people who are upset about this. , are somehow wrong, or bad people.You're the bad person for putting up with this bullshit."

1dongqe,vrbo,joegremlin,"VRBO has a name, email, phone number, credit card and a zip code, and that's it, unless you are verified.  Hosts ask for more information because people steal credit cards, book a last minute rental, then the money gets charged back by the original card's owner.  We ask for a copy of a driver's license to try and reduce fraud and verify the renter is over 25.  Did you read the agreement you signed when you booked it?  We put ""we will ask for verification of ID before sending a door code"" in the agreement."

1dp96jj,VRchat,BicycleClear6926,"For privacy and security, it really depends on the third party they choose.  They have not released any details yet.They stated that they are ""contracting verification out to a third party"".  This is speculation on my part, but I think that what will happen is after you submit your identification to the third party service, you will get a badge or something like that on your profile showing that you are verified, and verifying that you are over 18 or not.  So, VRChat will not handle your information.  And if you don't get verified, you just don't have a badge."
1dp96jj,VRchat,Ruddertail,"Yeah, I just hope they're really picky about what company they partner with, and don't just do like Twitter."

1dp96jj,VRchat,Cartload8912,"If this is private, secure, and optional, would that be the best move?If they do remote physical ID verification to verify age, then that's one of the worst possible verification methods to date. Electronic ID verification or in-person physical ID verification are far more secure and less privacy-invasive. For the EU, they should use the eID age verification process, or fallback to the postal office age verification service. The US is SOL and must rely on less secure age verification methods, and I'm guessing most other countries don't offer a similar age verification service either, so they're SOL too."

1etv1tp,VRchat,tupper,"We've released zero information on Age Verification other than ""we are looking into it and hope to release something this year.""Be wary of rumors that say anything beyond that -- people love making stuff up!"
1etv1tp,VRchat,Foolski,"If you're able to make age verified lobbies when it comes out, that would be a huge boon to the platform as it would allow adults to mingle and meet strangers again without kids running about. I really miss being able to go to public lobbies and reliably meet interesting strangers to talk to without having to block out the constant background noise of children screaming slurs."
1etv1tp,VRchat,Lylac-elixir,So most of the rumors I heard on this refer to the verification being outsourced to a reputable 3rd party service and not done by VRC directly. in the case of most of the services that provide age verification right now (looking at the few states in the US that implemented age verification on adult content) they typically use the ID to confirm age and send back to the platform a yes or no answer. so your personal info is not being given to VRC in that case and the 3rd party service should not be retaining info.
1etv1tp,VRchat,Rune_Fox,This is basically what they said in one of their devlogs earlier this year. They mention it at the bottom of this devloghttps://ask.vrchat.com/t/developer-update-11-july-2024/25514
1etv1tp,VRchat,IntelligentOlive8095,"The age verification would likely to be only to prove you're 18 and over, not 13. You'd still be able to play the game without proving your age, just not accessing some content that is 18+. If you're over 18 without an ID you have bigger problems in life than accessing 18+ content on VRChat."
1etv1tp,VRchat,Foxy02016YT,Oh please yes! Like how Roblox does it. Would be nice to have some safe spaces for adults
1etv1tp,VRchat,molluskich,"I'm fairly new to VRChat so I'm not sure how much my opinion matters, but I'd be glad to see the age rating raised to 18+. The amount of children I've seen running around hurling slurs and abuse at random players is appalling. I check profiles often and see so many minors listing their age. I look to see what groups they're in and honestly, it's concerning. There's no moderation or regulations in regards to keeping kids safe.As far as how age verification should be conducted, I don't know, I'm not the person to ask. I agree it's important that it's done in a way that doesn't keep a database on hand, that keeps player identities safe."
1etv1tp,VRchat,TurquoiseSoul02,"I don't think they're changing the entire platform to be  18+. Rather, most likely we're getting some sort of content and possibly instance gating so that only age verified users can access such things. So only a part would be 18+.Just a guess tho nothing's been confirmed yet."
1etv1tp,VRchat,ItsRosefall,"There has been talks of age verification, but that is all we realistically know, one thing is for sure tho, whatever VRChat is planning, it will almost certainly not involve scans or pictures of people's legal documents, such as ID, Passport or Driver's License, because it doesn't solve anything.For the game to know which content to display and which content to filter out, age restricted content must be flagged in some way as age restricted, if this falls on the content creators hands, most people wont care to do this, and percentage of people will activelly refuse to do it, to maximise the amount of exposure their content gets.Assuming you can somehow solve this issue and perfectly classify what type of content should and shouldn't be age restricted, you still created only a half-baked solution to the problem, kids who access VRChat through their parent's accounts or hardware will still be able to access age restricted content, new players and users who are unable or unwilling to verify their account with an ID  will complain about being locked in environments predominantly filled with children and content for children.All of what I just listed is surface level problems, there are many underlying issues and challenges with age verification on online platforms, which is why they aren't common placed on every corner of the internet. And even if VRChat somehow managed to invent the world's best age verification system on the planet, the problem would still persist, websites exist that distribute very real looking ID cards that work with swipe machines and even pass the blacklight test, as soon as this knowledge would become popular, people would start buying out and scanning fake IDs into VRChat to bypass the limitations that the age verification imposes on them. And the whole system would become nothing more but a small obstacle for most users."
1etv1tp,VRchat,prokjs,It's probably going to be the same or similar to how it is in roblox.
1fx9ay3,VRchat,Volpe-Momo,"I always thought an age verification system where once the devs or something verify you, you would receive a little badge (like when you have vrc+) this allowing you to make instances age verified only would be a great idea. Plus event and clubs would have an easier time, only having to look at a persons profile to see if they have the badge (plus a person wouldn’t have to verify every time a new club opens up). Honestly I don’t know why they haven’t done it yet unless they think they would be swapped with people wanting to verify, even so I would prefer waiting my turn and knowing that places would be safer, then have nothing at all."
1fx9ay3,VRchat,LakesRed,"Definitely for bars, clubs and peace of mind around certain activities"
1fx9ay3,VRchat,Street_Estate_6121,"Age verification is coming. When? Who knows, but VRChat is working on it."
1fx9ay3,VRchat,BunnyCreamPies,"I would love this in a perfect world. This is what should have been thought of back when you were required to have a Facebook account attached to a Meta one to even use a quest.This idea would be great but implementing n age verification method would likely cut into Meta's bottom line. If VRChat, as an entity who receives funding from Meta, creates some sort of official age gating mechanism that messes with the flow of users (mainly children getting quests every damn Christmas) they might pull funding from VRC and it disappears.It's a difficult situation. Unless they can convince Meta somehow, we're kind of doomed to do our own shoddy age gating until something changes."
1fx9ay3,VRchat,DracoBorg,I agree that this would be a simple solution that would drastically increase safety comfort and usability in any platform if they left this is an optional opt-in option as well as an optional filter but if VRChat were to do it themselves I could actually see this increasing their profits being a great way to filter out trolls and crack down on multi account harassment from individual's by making it opt-in just like it's optional to make an account with them to begin with or just use your platforms account but most people make the main account so they can connect to it on any device
1fx9ay3,VRchat,Technical_Disk6433,"The only thing that would work are parental controls on the quest restricting certain games, there isnt really a way to age verify in vrchat unless you could only get into certain worlds by paying a small fee using your credit card or something in order to get access to visiting that world but a system like that would turn off a lot of players. Other than that the only thing you can do is have controlled group instances where people ask you how old you are and then choose to kick you from the instance or ask you to leave if you're not old enough to be part of the instances"
1fx9ay3,VRchat,BusungenTb,I think it's a good idea but I just feel like it would be hard to implement really well

1gx69lt,VRchat,[deleted],"Because age-verification solutions that don't cost money are not effective at all.Were you ever a kid yourself? Because every kid I knew as a kid knew how to bypass every single age-verification that did not involve money.Money is the only thing bad parents care about, so that's why money-based verification services work. Kid charges something to a parent's card. Parent finally cares about what their neglected child is doing."

1h1dtac,VRchat,LostMelodyMunch,"If they do it the same way they do Roblox, they keep your information for 90 days, and then remove it, or as soon as they have accepted your age verification and checked it, then they remove the information."
1h1dtac,VRchat,ButterPuppet,they are doing it the best way posibleit doesnt instantly cut out the kids who have friend groups on vrc its just a way to filter them out of instances and thats all it needed to be
1h1dtac,VRchat,karlvonheinz,It's wild to me that people in the comments criticize them for using a third party service. There is literally no way around itI get that privacy is always at risk. But in 2024 you can't even use Tinder or E-Scooters without this kind of verification (at least in Germany)
1h1dtac,VRchat,[deleted],I’m not sure how comfortable I am with it being a US company handling the data.
1h5qqbg,VRchat,EmoExperat,But what if you delete that verified account? Can you then make a new account with your id?
1h5qqbg,VRchat,ZeakNato,great news for people that don't like ban evaders
1h5qqbg,VRchat,Shadowmirax,I though they were deleting your information 30 days after you verify? How will they know that an ID has been used twice after those 30 days when they can no longer see what ID the first account used?
1h5qqbg,VRchat,IkouyDaBolt,It is possible they could hash the information and use a bit of salt.  The same information resubmitted would generate the same hash but would not contain anything more than a string of letters and numbers.
1h5qqbg,VRchat,One-Tap,"Vrchat doesnt know, but the ID service knows. It’s an option persona has through their service."
1h5qqbg,VRchat,AdeonWriter,"There's a little math thing called hashes which lets you know if you've had the same data before even if you no longer have the data.You can't get data out of a hash, but if you get the same data again later, you'll get the same hash.And since the hash isn't your data, they keep it."
1h5qqbg,VRchat,BatRepresentative879,"The forum post and video make it clear that you can only verify one account per ID. I understand the reasoning, and largely agree with the benefits.However, I do wonder how this may affect content creators such as vtubers. In my case, I have a main account to use with friends, but another that's for my character. It's not malicious, privacy is just important for vtubers.It would be nice not to be gated out of instances or have people not want to associate with me because I'm not verified. Maybe exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis?"
1h5qqbg,VRchat,Unfair_Bunch519,This will cut down on the skinwalkers in public lobbies

1h7tcmi,VRchat,Docteh,"I feel bad for VRChat, they really like hey we're going to take our time and work on something over the next while (months) and get it done properly, and they've got two kinds of feedback.Persona is the devil (specifics are available on their forums or in other posts here. go look!)when can I do this thing, its been a whole 2 days or whatever"
1h7tcmi,VRchat,MuuToo,"First, not out yet. Second, ask a genie lamp. Cuz short of that, nobody knows."
1h7tcmi,VRchat,[deleted],"Scratch that, it’s still in testing, but slowly being drip fed in."
1h7tcmi,VRchat,MessyD557,"Scratch that, it’s still in testing, but slowly being drip fed in."
1h7tcmi,VRchat,shiro_tomo,Why do people downvote comments for no reason here XD
1h7tcmi,VRchat,Raitil,Before you verify:https://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/665658052-plaintiffs-accuse-persona-identities-inc-an-identity-verification-service-provider-of-illegally-using-personal-dataYour data almost certainlywillbe sold and/or used to train AI. Do not verify with Persona unless you're willing to give away your ID for free.
1h7tcmi,VRchat,sargrvb,"I am extremely pro-privacy. That being said, if you carry around a cell phone and do any transaction on it at all, you've been compromised. Look up 'Salt Typhoon'. The only people who are worried about age verification are all suddenly pro-privacy, but they have Amazon echo installed and most of us statistically play on Meta hardware which quite literally scans your entire room for data mining. They also sell your data and have been hacked in the past. VRChat is the least of your worries and I think getting rid of predditors is a much bigger issue."
1h7tcmi,VRchat,TheAssassinbatosai,"People honestly think they areTHATimportant that literally everyone wants their data. If you own any electronic device with internet access you're already being farmed, no exceptions. When that data gets sold it's along with thousands of other nameless people into a huge conglomerate of data points.Not only that what do you think having your data ""used to train AI"" means? You think they're gonna build some terminator to come and take you out? People need to relax and stop spouting nonsense about things they don't understand."
1h7tcmi,VRchat,Bavragor_Eisenfaust,Thats quite the reaching. First of all this only a suit. Everybody can sue no matter how good the chances of success are or if they have not a lot of evidence. So as long as there is no conviction and therefore enough evidence it is bullshit to make the claim that persona is selling data. Second it‘s as far as i can see only 2 people suing so it‘s not like there is a mass of people attached to this.Please dont spread misinformation just because you don‘t like age verification
1h7tcmi,VRchat,shirimpu,VRChat's implementation of Persona is a solution looking for a problem. A distraction from what is the myriad of problems and issues that plague the platform that VRChat wants to put under the rug.
1h8p7s5,VRchat,Silvercat18,"It's basically using a phone to send a pic of photo ID and possibly a pic of you for liveliness. Built into vrc, at no extra cost."
1h8p7s5,VRchat,BigAssDragoness,"Step 1: Stop listening to rumors and reading unverified sources.Step 2: There is no step 2.VRChat themselvesare going to be your best source of information on the process and its implementation. Everything else is hearsay and should be ignored unless provided with a trustworthy, vetted, and verified source."
1h8p7s5,VRchat,ethiopian1987,"Pirate Software says the exact same thing about people not reading it for themselves, and believing unverified things.From my understanding after watching both videos about it, and reading the FAQs, a third party company who specialise in ID verification will verify the ID and send only your date of birth to VRChat.The service is free and requires an unedited ID card. That is my understanding of it, though VRChat is the utmost source of information on how this works."
1h8p7s5,VRchat,XxXlolgamerXxX,You can check a lot of FAQ here:https://ask.vrchat.com/t/age-verification-faq/28458
1h8p7s5,VRchat,[deleted],"It's verification through Persona. Persona works with multiple companies to verify identification and one of those companies being Square.Persona has never had a major breach and they do not ""get hacked all the time"" as you will try to see people tell you without any proof or links.It costs no money for the end user to verify with Persona.You take a selfie, then take a picture of you'd ID. It's pretty simple."
1h8p7s5,VRchat,MrDrRandy,Vrchat released a video talking about this and what it entails
1h8p7s5,VRchat,ancoigreach,"If you want to know what is going on with VRChat, you should be in the official Discord, reading the pings, and reading/watching the Developer Updates, and reading the FAQs. Not listening to ""nasty rumours"".Here's a link to the official VRChat Discord:https://discord.com/invite/vrchatDeveloper Update on Age Verification, and the follow-up FAQ:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odiNjIFUNvwhttps://ask.vrchat.com/t/age-verification-faq/28458"
1h8p7s5,VRchat,Demuunii,Go into a public group black cat on a Friday/saturday night without a kid running up to you demanding your age or you’ll be kicked from the world - mission impossible
1h8p7s5,VRchat,Serious_Lifeguard_90,Finally! Time to kick out kids
1h8p7s5,VRchat,SeasaltApple382,I'm glad this is happening. What a welcome change.
1hbfdcc,VRchat,Delicious_Web495,This video shows that this update is getting promising but we might need another update in regards to the Age Verification just to convince those who don't trust this to sign up for this feature. Now I am willing to sign up and verify my age if something like a passport or voting vote could be used rather than risking my ID or SSN. A public or group instance without the kids would be a nice breather and I would like to just join or casually walk around without thinking about a data breach happening at any point.
1hbfdcc,VRchat,millsj402zz,Yeah I would verify if I actually trusted them. I have alternative methods that worked with persona in the past
1hbfdcc,VRchat,Dividedthought,My only question here has to do with VRC's insistence that personal deletes our information once the check is complete. How can we verify this?
1hbfdcc,VRchat,landroverattack,"I believe it's impossible to prove the non-existence of anything, let alone digital data. At some point, you have to take someone's word for it, I'm afraid."
1hbfdcc,VRchat,[deleted],"I heavily criticized them for poor communication around anti-cheat.This is so much better in every possible way. Explaining first, listening to feedback, testing and then implementing it. Regardless of my feelings towards the actual thing being implemented, the whole team has done a pretty good job all things considered.In terms of the actual Age Verification.... . SSN would be a hard no-go simply because of how just...insecure that whole system is already. I think they already stated Passports are a valid ID, so I think that would be fine."
1hbfdcc,VRchat,Minxy57,Almost every bit of my personal data has been breached a dozen times over in countless hacks. Cyber security has become an oxymoron.With this change I trust Tupper far more than half the other institutions 'protecting' my personal information.I'll validate my age in a heartbeat once this becomes available.
1hbfdcc,VRchat,LegallyRegarded,agreed. I got my Credit locked for a reason.
1hbfdcc,VRchat,DepreMelon,"Finally no more annoying people on a  power trip asking redundantly ""age and date of birth"" lmao"
1hbfdcc,VRchat,Jupiter_Five,"i've only gone through them a few times but there was one instance where i stated my actual age as an adult, and the person asking just thought i was using a voice changer, probably thinking i was lying about my age, if i can verify it without having to risk compromising personal information then that means i finally will have to deal with those kinds of people a lot less"
1hbfdcc,VRchat,mikakor,"Hey, it's a Runa!"
1hdopi2,VRchat,tupper,"Not been rolled out yet! Soon, keep an eye out :D"
1hdopi2,VRchat,ghastlymars,Is this a “game releases the same day as it’s revealed” soon or a valve soon?
1hdopi2,VRchat,Gwolfz21,hi what link do i use to age verify/ get an email for age verify
1hdopi2,VRchat,bunnythistle,"To my understanding they have not started rolling it out to any groups just quite yet, but soon."
1hdopi2,VRchat,JereTR,"As of the video posted a couple days ago, it's not implemented yet.  They need to get the hashing design prepared first, and then the groups that have been chosen will get to start to test it out."
1hdopi2,VRchat,zakku_88,"I don't think it's been rolled out yet, at least not fully"
1hdopi2,VRchat,BadDogMonkeyboy,
1hehgro,VRchat,gLu3xb3rchi,"Depends on the Group. If its clearly NSFW group ask some form of ID or a trusted Person to vouch for them.If its not NSFW and semi serious, ask some stupid question like „what musik was popular in your highschool years?“ and guestimate the age from there. Or another fun one is „what was your favorite game you played as a kid‘"
1hehgro,VRchat,Polar_Bean,"Not vrc, but in a discord I had with nsfw channels, when someone requested access, I'd send a picture of a floppy disk and ask them to identify what was in the picture. If they said it was the save icon, I knew they were under 18."
1hehgro,VRchat,Cinnaki,"I tip my hat to you, that's hilarious."
1hehgro,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,Genius xD
1hehgro,VRchat,Mentally-Ill-Ladybug,"Like other comments said, depends on the group. Most sfw bar groups and such just ask for DOB at the door and use the honor system, but most NSFW clubs (like lap dance clubs) use discord to ID verify people before they're let into the event, which ik sounds sketch but imo it's better than finding out ur stripping for a minor 🤷‍♀️"
1hehgro,VRchat,Aggravating-Wafer-32,"I asked one guy how old he was and he said, ""Eighteen?"". I had my doubts and asked what year he was born. He responded with, ""I think I've made a big mistake "" and disappeared."
1hehgro,VRchat,UwU_Incognitus,"Guess what, they normally just use the same method. Ask people for their age, there are some groups that use a discord bot or other websites a person can use to verify their actual ID card to get into group private instances. Some just have a guy who runs the group, askes people for their ID in a Discord DM, the sketchiest way of doing it."
1hehgro,VRchat,SansyBoy144,"I’m not a group mod, but as someone who erp’s with a lot of people, often who I’ll meet that day, I can share my many methods. In no particular order.I always start by checking their bio, not just for age, but also seeing if their bio checks out. While this is never 100% I have no issues being wrong about assuming someone who puts Roblox in their bio is underage.Start a conversation about jobs. Even an adult who has never had a job will have something to say about this, and honestly this is a super easy way to discern between the two. It’s not just about them having or not having a job, but any adult knows what I mean when I say you can tell who is a child or an adult based on how they talk about jobs. This is by far the best piece of advice I have on figuring it out. Us adults come across the conversation all the time, and kids will rarely talk about it.College is another talking point, although I don’t always do this one, I prefer talking about jobs.Judging based off of voice is never perfect, but can be helpful. Yes there’s some adults who sound like children and a lot of children who sound like adults, never rely on this on its own, but use this with the others. Like if there’s someone who sounds like a kid, has a bio that says he loves fnaf and Roblox, and didn’t seem to relate to having a job, I’m immediately saying that’s a kid.Don’t be afraid to ask questions. I always ask for Age. Which sometimes they will lie, and expect that if they are a kid then they will lie. But it helps to double check. Also if they say they are 18, or even 19, I honestly just wouldn’t touch it unless you’re also around that age. But if you are, one thing I used to ask when I was 20 was if they are still in highschool. Often times they’ll answer truthfully and I think everyone agrees that even doing stuff with an 18 yo in hs is weird and creepy.Obviously this is not perfect. Which is why if you are not 100% sure, then don’t do anything, it’s not worth it. But there are times when you can be 100% sure. And these can help you get there."
1hehgro,VRchat,Cinnaki,"I also have a series of seemingly random questions I ask that sometimes help. First one I ask is who were the presidential candidates the first time you voted. Not who you voted for, just who they were. But a lot of the questions center around subjects you already talked about. I agree, talking about jobs is the best way I've been able to be more confident a person who sounds young is an adult."
1hehgro,VRchat,josephlucas,We just ask people. If they say they are 18+ we believe them. We have a small chill group so it hasn’t been a problem.
1hg3q77,VRchat,Smac3223,"To clarify, it's out in ""BETA"". Only groups that have the link to verify are getting it.When this Age-Verification rolls out officially and not in beta, then we should all be able to verify much easier."
1hg3q77,VRchat,GutsBoi,How do you know if you've gotten the link? is it through email or some other way?
1hg3q77,VRchat,[deleted],"what group did you use? I'm in a group that made an announcement theyre in the beta but no link has been given and there's been no 18+ instances. Why does it feel like nobody wants to ""allow"" others to verify? xD"
1hg3q77,VRchat,DrBlackRat,Age Verification is now available to a selected amount of VRChat Groups for testing! So you have to be in one of those to be able to verify.
1hg3q77,VRchat,personman44,Did you get the blue VRChat badge on your profile by being one of the people who age verified during this testing period? Or did you already have that from something else? I noticed the badge when I got curious what groups had age verification and opened your profile to look at the groups
1hg3q77,VRchat,thatFurryTaran,Witch groups?
1hg3q77,VRchat,DrBlackRat,For everyone that’s curious about the privacy info in the email you get from VRChat
1hg3q77,VRchat,DrBlackRat,"This is what it looks like in the client, it’s a bit cramped but it works. You have to set if you want to show it btw, it’s hidden by default currently!"
1hg3q77,VRchat,SgtXotiic,im in a group that has the 18+ beta but im still confused what app I'm using to verify and how its connect to my vrc account
1hg3q77,VRchat,DragonTamerWes,I'm waiting for a discord group I'm to get it. I don't want to join a group for only age verification.
1hggyto,VRchat,KingSlayer05,"Curious why there's an option for Verified VS Verified 18+ if you arent going to hide the badge? I thought you had to be 18 to play VRChat but I might be wrong lmao.But yeah, looking forward to more instances with less racist-ass screeching kids!"
1hggyto,VRchat,Cinnamonbaar,"I think people under 18 can be age verified, just not 18+. Vrchat is 13+, I think, but still I'm not sure why there needs to be a 13-18 verified. Maybe to make sure they're not a bot?"
1hggyto,VRchat,BiploarFurryEgirl,You can be 13 on VRC
1hggyto,VRchat,zig131,"VRChat is officially 13+A 17 year old could get Verified now, and when they turn 18 they will get the ability to show the 18+ badge."
1hggyto,VRchat,Central_Fire154,"Congrats! I did mine a bit ago, I dont get to see it on my profile until I get home sadly."
1hggyto,VRchat,the_unknow990,Howmm Do u get like an email or something???
1hggyto,VRchat,Cinnamonbaar,"I happened to be in a group that had signed up for the age verification beta, then I clicked a link in that group's discord which led to the vrchat site, which let me press a button to send me an email and verify. So definitely check all of your group's discords!"
1hggyto,VRchat,PrincessRabbitChan,How did you do that??
1hggyto,VRchat,PlayfulParticular402,How?? I been searching on the internet for the past 2 day
1hggyto,VRchat,SuspiciousPrimary758,How to do this on quest?
1hgk7h6,VRchat,bunnythistle,Now stop clogging my homepage with screenshots of your badge >:VI legitimately don't understand why we need five different threads announcing that Age Verification is here. The first thread seemed adequate enough.
1hgk7h6,VRchat,MuuToo,Everyone thinks they’re the first and are excited about it. Give it a week or so.
1hgk7h6,VRchat,MuuToo,"For me, the online personal privacy ship sailed off long ago. Obviously I implore everyone to take whatever precautions they need to feel safe. But like, Google, Meta, Apple, and so many other companies have so much data on me that for me, another company that seemingly had a pretty good track record isn’t gonna be the hill I die on."
1hgk7h6,VRchat,ScienceAndLogic-,"i agree, unless your some super rich private celeb, using anything on the internet will most likely cause your information to be somewhere you dont like or want it to and atp we cant really control that unless u live like a hermit"
1hgk7h6,VRchat,SpectorEscape,"I will note so many companies have had lawsuits in Illinois because of their extremely strict laws on keeping info like that. I have a family member who has gotten a good amount of class action money due to it. Target has gotten sued, companies that use biometrics to get into work have gotten sued etc etc"
1hgk7h6,VRchat,Loc5000,your state issue ID Number gives access and information that you can't get with just a name and address. Facebook doesn't even have that info. Most businesses don't. The VRChat devs dont' have any malicious reasons for the info but its still something you should be cautious about. Plus its not hard to hop onto an already verified account via family or friends and still be under 18. So this will make it harder but not impossible
1hgk7h6,VRchat,Toklankitsune,yes but at that point it's easy to prove the minor is the one in the wrong and protects the adults in the room from legal ramifications that can arise from a minor being in spaces they don't belong in. Which is the whole point of this age verification thing.
1hgk7h6,VRchat,AmazingPomegranate83,Anyone who pays for VRC+ has already given away their name and address. I don't see the same people complaining about that?
1hgk7h6,VRchat,BUzer2017,"We give that to Steam, not to VRChat"
1hgk7h6,VRchat,_Pendragon,"Another really good point! If your banking info is already tied to your VRC account, most of the data you'd be worried about getting leaked is already right there."
1hgv7hj,VRchat,GlitchPhoenix98,Hey it's my turn to post about it! Check the wait-list and wait your turn!
1hgv7hj,VRchat,PinkLithium,Wooot Woot
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Foxyr_,"We need more post! Ppl must know that I got age verified! Its not like half of playerbase will be in a few weeks lmaoThen we also need the other side of hating on it!Jokes aside, its really great that we got age verifications, yet I do wanna know what is the ""minimum requied"" data they use to generate the hash they are going to store. (they didnt specify)"
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Maverick23A,guys i've tried creating an account on the persona website and calling their number but they won't return my calls or emails what do i do??? /s
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Pokabrows,"Right now you need to be in one of the groups involved in the early roll out and click a link they give you (likely in their discord). Otherwise you'll just need to be patient, it's not out to everyone yet."
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,"You got it, gonna do some more"
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Kitsune257,"My main question is what is really the use of age verification? I’m not really in public worlds, and I don’t ever engage in NSFW stuff. So not exactly sure why at least in my case I would have to do age verification."
1hgv7hj,VRchat,CommunicationSad6246,The age verification is for group 18+ worlds not public since 18+ content is not ment to be in the public’s
1hgv7hj,VRchat,Background_Fudge_798,anyone got any groups with this verification that still have slots?
1hho8z9,VRchat,Cute-Plantain2865,"Nsfw is still against tos but is unlikely to get reported in private and now adult spaces.There is a bit of a trust factor in adult spaces. Hopefully, age verified instances will allow for changes in ToS but if you are reported it will be handled just like before.NSFW assets will be removed. So just don't upload PP and run around with it and you will probably be fine."
1hho8z9,VRchat,StoragePotential6352,Ohhh so that's why most of my avatars have been removed! I didn't know they were against TOS
1hho8z9,VRchat,NOINSEVUNT,Yeah no NSFW content is still in the same spot: Technically banned but only enforcable if you're reported
1hho8z9,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,Nobody said NSFW activity will be ok with ToS after adding verification.But honestly they don't care as long as you keep your fun in private.
1hho8z9,VRchat,Breaker1ove,"Simple answer:Public world report - You getting banned.Private world report - meh.""Remember, Keep private things private"""
1hho8z9,VRchat,Shadowraid5,"I know in private it takes a report for them to step in on a ToS ruling, but I heard somewhere where that there is a limit to what's considered ""Private""Like Friends only is Private, of course, but a Friends+ isn't because friends of the people in it can join without even knowing that it's an 18+ conversation.Just what I've heard around the grapevine, not sure if the Devs see it that way."
1hho8z9,VRchat,[deleted],In the first video they released talking about it they said it's something they're looking into for the future but for now just want the feature out for everyone to make more comfortable and safe spaces for adults and minors in their chosen instances.
1hho8z9,VRchat,lilfox3372,18+ doesn't give permission to be anymore sexual or weird. Keep it to private places that permit it. This verification doesn't change how the game operates
1hho8z9,VRchat,XxXlolgamerXxX,"Yup, the TOS don't change. Is the same rules. You cannot do nsfw stuffs in public instances. (Technically Neither in private but it would require that somebody report you). NSFW include a lot of stuffs. For example a +18 instance that have a party where people drink alcohol is okay, but is still a nsfw stuff.Having a nsfw avatar and do stuffs and record that stuffs and publish the video even if is a +18 instance is still against the TOS.They also say that in the future content filter can be used by the verification so maybe the TOS can change in the future."
1hho8z9,VRchat,llagroozll,I hope u can implement the age verification in worlds.. so that we can have full Adault Drinking night's
1hi3l5p,VRchat,LegallyRegarded,"i mena, i guess you'd have to talk to VRC mods jsut like you would any other time youd get banned. The only thing the 18+ verification would stop you from doing is making another acount and verifying again, which I think is a good thing, because that means people who are verified will be less likley to be shitheads."
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Careful-Kiwi9206,"no because i literally got banned a month or so ago for client modifications, i don’t even have a pc AND I DONT KNOW HOW TO USE CLIENTS 😭😭(i tried to appeal it and i never got a response)"
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Hades6578,"I was banned for a similar reason, no response other than the instant deny I got for the first one. It’s not just you and I’m worried that this may be due to mods power tripping."
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Artificial_Lives,This is a positive.If you get banned and deserve it im glad you'll be locked out of verification if you make a new account.If banned and didn't deserve it you appeal it just like you do now .The only reason I see people annoyed by this is if they want to be shitty and just make new accounts
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Hades6578,I mean if their appeal system actually worked and they didn’t turn down submissions with robots…
1hi3l5p,VRchat,IkouyDaBolt,"If banned and didn't deserve it you appeal it just like you do now .Over the past 20 years, I've played a handful of various video games.  Whether it be virtual pet sites, MMORPGs, FPSes...The issue persists where an actor can craft enough inquiries and the account is locked.  We're in 2024, we shouldnotbe having to worry about it.  World of Warcraft currently has this issue.If it were something like a temporarily lock on an account until an actual human reviews the data and decides appropriately on the user's behalf that's one thing.  As it stands, needing users to jump through hoops could easily be utilized to put more strain on VRChat's staff than they already have.Aside: I had an Apple account deactivated for a similar reason.  Imagine having a disabled iPhone for 24 hours."
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Hades6578,"I got falsely banned before the age verification bit, they’re continuing to ignore me, I need to get through to them because it was very wrong"
1hi3l5p,VRchat,XxXlolgamerXxX,"The thing is: that also can happen even without verification, a lot of people dont have the posibility to change hardware or ip. So is the same imo. Also Persona and VRChat dont store personal data after the verification, just the date of birth and a hash, using another method of verification in theory would generate another hash."
1hi3l5p,VRchat,Acceptable-Bat-9577,I’d be more concerned by the fact that this Persona company is currently facing a massive lawsuit for misusing personal data for their own profit and benefit.
1hi3l5p,VRchat,[deleted],That's not what the lawsuit is about. It's a suit from Illinois (a state with some of the most strict data laws) that is stating Persona has stored data without the proper channels of consent of that data being stored.
1hkc2xk,VRchat,rcbif,"Age verification is still in Beta phase, no likely no real change."
1hkc2xk,VRchat,Hexent_Armana,"Man, thats a shame. While I have met SOME chill minors I haven't met many. Overall VRChat would be a more enjoyable game if these children couldn't even log in."
1hkc2xk,VRchat,Breaker1ove,Christmas after noon and the day after Christmas I unmute visitors and help them with learning the menu and stuff. You are free to do the same. Im often the only one doing it.
1hkc2xk,VRchat,Rune_Fox,"I've started making it a tradition of changing my status to something like ""new to vrc? Ask me for help"" around Christmas."
1hkc2xk,VRchat,RevolutionarySpare87,I try and do that anytime I meet someone new to vrc.The two months i spent with personal space on cause i was never told i could turn it off won’t be repeated by any new people haha.
1hkc2xk,VRchat,Syvestral,"This is so nice, I'll be doing this too :) thanks for the idea. Merry Christmas!"
1hkc2xk,VRchat,Sanquinity,"I doubt it'll get fully implemented before new year's since it's less than 2 weeks away. That being said, groups weren't a thing yet last year. So I think that'll already make a big change. I think there will be a lot more adults in group publics now, whom in turn will try to keep kids out as much as possible."
1hkc2xk,VRchat,zyclonix,"Im actually kinda hyped. While we did have floods of kids the last few years thanks to the quest we can now open up 18+ instances, so meeting new people will actually become fun again, i wont really be bothered by kids this year"
1hkc2xk,VRchat,aplen22,System still in Beta and Devs are in a code freeze for the holidays. Nothing is happening until January.
1hkc2xk,VRchat,Remarkable_Guide_394,"the only reason i'm not completely sure on age vari is because of the people who are under 18, but have multiple years on the game and are known or trusted users who are just trying to meet new people. the whole age vari thing would leave me in a world wit ha bunch of 12 years old's moaning at the top of their lungs just to be funny and nobody to talk to."
1hog6cl,VRchat,SeraXI,"You click the link, it sends you an e-mail with another link.  You click that link from your phone, take a picture of your ID, then it will ask you to hold the camera in front of your face and rotate it around your head left to right to make sure you are alive.Then it's done.  Badge option becomes available."
1hog6cl,VRchat,--an,The initial roll-out was pretty small with haphazardly chosen groups and I have seen only a few 18+ instances. It will take some time and a proper release for verification to mean anything.
1hog6cl,VRchat,ncamp84,Don’t have to give an age and birthday at the bar worlds now. I just say I’m verified and they look at my profile and let me in. I didn’t go to those kind of worlds before because I don’t like giving that information out to random people on the internet. Plus I’m older and I don’t have to hear all the BS that comes with that when I did say it.
1hog6cl,VRchat,nesnalica,the verification or having the badge on ur profile
1hog6cl,VRchat,Idontmatter69420,"i havent ""used"" it yet bc i dont really visit many instances like that, im usually only with a friend and then with their friends who i dont know personally but we see each other a fair bit and get along pretty well"
1hog6cl,VRchat,Pokabrows,I haven't actually seen a verified instance yet so mostly just a cool little profile badge.The actual verification process with an ID card and your face was really quick and went smoothly. Which I mean is probably a big part of why they went with persona.
1hog6cl,VRchat,Uhohspagetti0sss,"I was roleplaying as a barista in a world when it first rolled out and some dude sat down and bragged about his badge and then asked for ""the special"" I then proceeded to give him a cup of iced milk."
1hog6cl,VRchat,lilfox3372,I didn't get checked for age at an event (cool). I got approached and flirted with because I was verified and it's 'okay' (uncool)
1hog6cl,VRchat,Mysterious_Edge3877,"Shiny new tag, other then that go to Age verified instances where you dont have to worry about people below 18."
1hog6cl,VRchat,RamJamR,"Which I think helps people below 18 as well.  We have our space, they have theirs."
1hzkhvd,VRchat,MuuToo,"I've seen some people tryna argue it's easy for a kid to fake an ID or use their parent's, but then in the next breath say they'll ask people for ages, as if it's totally secure and people can't just verbally lie."
1hzkhvd,VRchat,Pokabrows,Exactly! I feel like ID verification is at least harder to fake than saying a birthday.If I had realized the ID thing was gonna be completely ignored I wouldn't have bothered to get ID verified...
1hzkhvd,VRchat,Evaunit01berser,That's when you know people have no idea how the system works.The kids are not faking a face scan
1hzkhvd,VRchat,nekogarrett,It's their only sauce of power. They sit in front of a wall and it's their only ability of interactions.
1hzkhvd,VRchat,SpectorEscape,Don't you know! The random dude taking his bouncer roleplay too seriously is more trustworthy then a system that requires actual ID!
1hzkhvd,VRchat,Chambers1041,"Yeah I got asked for DOB the other day, told him ""click my profile I have the 18+ badge"" ""DOB please"".Clownery."
1hzkhvd,VRchat,Pokidoki123,"I went to JustB club host by Heavenly Paradise last week and got ask for DOB eventho I tell them to please check my profile. He told me that he still ask anyway because his boss tell him to do so and say that ""kids manage to get verified"" and ""Don't trust the system"".I want Age Verify system to act like how you take off your hat to show your bald spot when ask for ID to enter the bar."
1hzkhvd,VRchat,RedTaxx,As if people can’t lie about that smh
1hzkhvd,VRchat,[deleted],"Eventually the system will go public, and the better groups will make their public instances age gated.It's in beta with barely any access. Most people don't know how it works nor is it possible to make gated instances without excluding most adults in the game.Give it time. Eventually instances that aren't gated simply won't be visited by adults for specific worlds and events. When that happens, stragglers will adapt or fall into obscurity."
1hzkhvd,VRchat,Barasu1,"If they won't use my vrchat verification, I just leave."
1i0701o,VRchat,AdeonWriter,"Even more hilarious is after you have the official 18+ badge on your profile.I heard this exchange with a very old man voice, that shouldn't have even been asked in the first place:""Look at my profile. I'm officially age verified with VRChat.""""We don't trust that, they use an untrustworthy website to age verify, you have to tell us your birthday""""So let me get this straight, you don't trust a website that asks for my ID, but you're ok with me just saying some numbers to you without proof?""They then banned him."
1i0701o,VRchat,ItsYaBoyBackAgain,"This has happened to me at a few places too. I say the same thing too, about how silly it is to not trust the official badge over asking for age and date of birth which is very easily exploitable. Never works, insta ban every time lol. I think those people are a bit too addicted to the small feeling of power and authority they get when age verifying people."
1i0701o,VRchat,GentleGesture,"Age verification becomes secondary to making sure you’re a rule follower. Will you comply and work with the current “authority” smoothly, or will you raise problems and make the job of moderating harder than they want? Also, don’t mind the 14 yo sounding girl they rush in behind you, before she could even finish answering the birthday verification question, after she stuttered out a fake birthday she wasn’t confident in. “You’re good, you can go.”"
1i0701o,VRchat,AmazingPomegranate83,They are rolling out 18+ verified badges soon for public release so asking for age and DOB should become a thing of the past with adult-only instances (not to mention it's unreliable).
1i0701o,VRchat,Pokabrows,So far even with the verified badges I've still had to say my age and birthday because supposedly kids are getting their parents to verify accounts.The thing is I feel like it's easier to lie about your age and birthday than the verification thing.Sure some kid may have convinced a parent to verify but uh anyone can figure out a birthday and age.
1i0701o,VRchat,PlushySnake,"If the dumbasses don't trust the ID verification badge, it is better to leave the world imo. Their excuse stating that it is easy for kids to get that verification is lying and it doesn't hold fruit when they trust someone to verbally say their age instead lol.People who do this are power tripping when they could easily allow the verified 18+ badge users inside."
1i0701o,VRchat,charlieblood_8,"Those must be group public, not public instances. If an 18+ group is hosting, then they might ask you your age. I'm age verified but still have people ask for my age since it is not mainstream for now.Edit: And there is usually a bell to notify the staff if there is a barrier to let you in."
1i0701o,VRchat,Hellzer0,"honestly i dont like it either, but its either this or every public world would just be like a daycare since most of the player base is now a 5 year old on quest...tho there are some group publics that dont directly ask you but will kick annoying kids whenever they find them, which seems a bit less awkward."
1i0701o,VRchat,Adventurous-Gold-964,I got kicked from blackcat  said am 32 was kicked
1i0701o,VRchat,Silly-Problem-2836,I'm 33 and every time someone demands my age and date of birth I just tell them to eat my ass. I'm so fed up of it.
1icgnpg,VRchat,dandy443,"It’s just early access people. They can’t just dump it at once and either cause issues on the other companies server, or it could cause financial damages. Since they are paying for the service themselves. If anything this likely means it will be out in general soon.Plus imho limiting it to groups was dumb, as most of those were not going to distance themselves from their audience for a test."
1icgnpg,VRchat,RadElert_007,"Hijacking the top comment because some people here are straight up spreading misinformation about age verification being ""paywalled"" or VRC+ exclusive.Please see the below from the official VRChat twitter.https://x.com/VRChat/status/1884393142293573764Its not gonna be a VRC+ exclusive feature. It never was going to be a VRC+ exclusive feature and if you watched their videos on the topic. You'd know that.They did the same thing with the Android client roll out."
1icgnpg,VRchat,saikouyua,I am so appreciative of this feature. I often find myself annoyed and wanting to get away from the kids but find very few monitored lobbies and when I do find them I’m often mistaken as a child due to my voice. Can’t wait to see how the how age verification possibilities in game play out.
1icgnpg,VRchat,SmallTownLoneHunter,shouldnt age verification be a basic feature in this game?
1icgnpg,VRchat,ancoigreach,"It will be. I feel like a broken record at this point, but as I say pretty much every time I visit this sub, Age Verification is in testing, the plan was always to roll it out slowly, it is not fully implemented yet."
1icgnpg,VRchat,[deleted],"It is.Like Android access, it's early access to VRC+ first."
1icgnpg,VRchat,sesor33,It costs VRChat money every verification they do. The cost of your VRC+ subscription is offsetting it
1icgnpg,VRchat,Ambitious_Singer5519,Yes
1icgnpg,VRchat,NessieNep,Afaik VRC are the only ones pay walling ID verification in this manner.Roblox doesn't do this (they also use Persona btw).Neither does Fetlife.Neither did Second Life when it supported ID verification afaik.I really hope this is temporary like a lot of people are getting the impression of and it just becomes a basic feature for everyone eventually.Edit: What I fear is that other companies that don't paywall ID verification might start doing so if they think they can get away with it.
1icgnpg,VRchat,Breaker1ove,where do you find this?
1iefs5f,VRchat,Eternal_Ohm,"Yes you keep it, this is stated on their blog.https://hello.vrchat.com/blog/age-verification"
1iefs5f,VRchat,Darkstone_BluesR,Thanks!
1iefs5f,VRchat,AryaDRed,"Yep, if you dont have vrc+ but got age verified from the group drop you also still have it"
1iefs5f,VRchat,BlizzrdSnowMew,"Yes but I used it as an excuse to finally actually use VRC+.  I'm not sure if I'll use any of the other features, but I spend so much time in VRC I think it's time I finally start supporting them lol"
1iefs5f,VRchat,nesnalica,i dont understand why so many randomly assume itll disappear if you don't have vrc+lol
1iefs5f,VRchat,Darkstone_BluesR,Been on VRC for little over a month. It is completely normal to ask questions about things you do not know.
1iefs5f,VRchat,PonyUpDaddy,"Man, they really monetized 18+ content and I find it hilarious this question comes up a lot"
1iefs5f,VRchat,tailslol,"Yes ,they plan to release it to free users at a later date"
1iefs5f,VRchat,KeyboardHaver,"That is not guaranteed, actually. On their developer update they mention the following.How Age Verification works could change in the future. It might be tied to VRC+ forever… or maybe it isn’t tied to anything at all. We don’t know yet and so we’re leery about making any absolute statement.https://ask.vrchat.com/t/developer-update-30-january-2025/40905Their blogpost meanwhile seems to hint at this only being temporary.From what I gathered, theywantto make it free, but may not have the ability to do so due to it costing money for them."
1igy0ul,VRchat,bunnythistle,"Currently age verification is only available to VRChat+ users, and since it costs VRChat money per each verification it's unclear if that's going to change in the near future or not. This means that anyone without VRChat+ obviously won't be able to verify without subscribing or getting a gift subscription.Of course, with that feature not being available to everyone, that does limit its usefulness too."
1igy0ul,VRchat,Helgafjell4Me,Pretty sure the plan is to open it to everyone. VRC+ just gets early access.
1igy0ul,VRchat,SupOrSalad,"The last few nights I’ve been hanging out in verified only 18+ lobbies, and it’s been a breath of fresh air. Just a bunch of people hanging out like old vrchat. Almost nobody at the mirrors, no kids running around trying to troll. It felt like old vrchat again"
1igy0ul,VRchat,zakku_88,"It's technically still in testing phase/slow rollout. I don't think anyone can say for certain how well it works (or doesn't) until it becomes more widely available.My hope is that (when released fully) it not only provides better public spaces for adults, but also helps make it easier to spot predators somehow"
1igy0ul,VRchat,abluecolor,How would it possibly make it more easy to spot predators? Seems like a side effect of this will be making it easier to find spaces with tons of kids. Predators won't be verifying their accounts.
1igy0ul,VRchat,Femboy_Go_Beep_Beep,"I think the verification system is going to be a massive improvement to this game with 18+ instances. The best part is that the verification is actually more secure then marketed, you can verify without sending a full id photo. I covered all information on mine except for the photo and date of birth in masking tape and it still  accepted the id. I wish they would market that as a feature so more people could worry less over security, hopefully they will at some point."
1igy0ul,VRchat,TunaDawson110,"I was age checked today. Im 18+ verified. Dude told me he doesn't trust 18+ verification because ""there was this kid"" then he got cut off"
1igy0ul,VRchat,chyadosensei,Had the same situation. Maybe same person? They're just are so heart broken with the idea that bouncers will be obsolete with this new feature.
1igy0ul,VRchat,smalldroplet,I was one of the first to get it in the beta and people still harass me about my age verbally at instances when I ask them kindly to look at my profile.
1igy0ul,VRchat,Sanquinity,"Honestly at this point if ""bouncers"" don't accept the age verification I simply don't want to be in their instance. Because 1: That means their own ""age verification"" (asking for age) is flawed and the instance will likely have minors in it anyway, and 2: They're likely on a power trip, wanting to be the one to decide to gets to enter. But can't think of other reasons to do so than age.Like, they added age verification specifically to provide a secure way to determine if someone is 18+. If a group doesn't want to make use of it I don't trust that group."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,Capable-Trip-4423,"sounds like some idiot at the bar world still wanting to flex their only modicum of power and still ask for IDs. I don't know any way it can be bypassed in this way, and it's likely a lie to still ask for your ID and stuff."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,Sheimusik,kinda stupid that they say age verification isn't valid when someone can literally just lie about their age vocally and that somehow works for them like bruh
1iuaj4z,VRchat,blueskyredmesas,Virtual bouncers aren't beating the allegations.
1iuaj4z,VRchat,LimitAffectionate266,"I literally always  say ""11th of september 2001"" anytime im asked my dob and not once has anyone batted an eye, i think only once did I hear a bouncer go ""wait wtf"" after he already let me through, they literally dont care or double check, its all about the power trip for them"
1iuaj4z,VRchat,Mr_SunnyBones,"Hey , some of us actually DO have Sep 11 as a birthday , admittedly I was in my 20s when the towers fell."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,RadElert_007,"No, they arent. Bar bouncers just wanna big dick and still feel important."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,justsmokeweedkids,"I feel like people that claim the bypassing stuff are ignorant of the actual verification process. You literally have to scan each side of your face along with your license. Unless you’re a clueless/unconscious/intoxicated parent or adult, I just don’t see how that’s possible for a minor to successfully pull off considering the requirements. Getting ahold of an account that’s already been verified is more realistic tbh. Even then, that’s hardly an excuse to disregard verified users as a whole. Shit, even getting age verification for IMVU has less requirements than VRC."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,VioViridian,"This sounds like a load of horseshit that bouncers tell themselves so they can power trip. I age verified my account and it would be harder for a kid to get through. Unless they can steal an id, have the adult be intoxicated or unconscious somehow, there isn’t a good way of getting around it. The alternative is kids buying age verified accounts, which wouldn’t surprise me if it was happening."
1iuaj4z,VRchat,MuuToo,No. They get some weird power trip from being an inconvenience and forcing you to stop for 'em.
1iuaj4z,VRchat,Tyrilean,How is you telling them a date going to be more secure than the actual verification?
1j03tol,VRchat,zig131,"A really nonchalant/oblivious/shitty parent could let a child scan thier ID and face 🤷 . Or I guess they could pay another adult, but each ID is one time use.No system is 100% foolproof.However if the child was exposed to anything, that would be 100% on the parent and VRC would not be liable as they have done due diligance.But generally these people still asking for age without checking for the badge first are on an ego trip, and think they have some kind of super voice age detection powers."
1j03tol,VRchat,Boney_McBonerton_YT,"Honestly I was heavily picking up an power trip vibe from the guy checking users, I just didn't bring it up in case someone got their undies in a twist."
1j03tol,VRchat,turtledude01,"This right here.  Any group or club in vrchat declining to accept the vrchat proven age verification is actually putting the liability of allowing an underage person on themselves.  If a user is verified illegitimately they can also be banned and the ID will never be usable again (might be wrong on this but it's highly likely to be true).  Anyone either asking for age and DOB or asking you to join a discord and ID/ FACE verify instead of trusting the vrchat system (trust but verify, I've still ask just age) is simply believing they are a better judge of real/ fake IDs than any legitimate iD system."
1j03tol,VRchat,TheShortViking,"How the fuck do they think asking people their age is better? If someone gets past the verification then of course they are going to lie about their age. How dense are these bouncers?Like is this how they think its going to go?""Hey how old are you?""""I'm verified""""I don't trust the shitty verification, answer the question!""""Ohh, yea I'm 15"""
1j03tol,VRchat,Skylar_Drasil,"They are extremely dense, I legit used the VRC chatbox to say “I already verified” once, they said they didnt trust it, so I told them what they wanted (also through the chatbox) and they let me through. Legit double standard there"
1j03tol,VRchat,pinkiceygirl,Truly there is no winning with these people and I largely suspect a lot of them just wish to power trip. I’d rather believe an ID system over someone just blurting an age they memorized to get in. (basically the equivalent of clicking “yes I’m 18” on adult sites) are these systems fool-proof? No but it is so much better than what we had considering people begged for this to be in place.
1j03tol,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,"Oh yes, but asking the age is 100% safe. Like we live in a world where lying will kill you right? Nobody lies about it for sure..."
1j03tol,VRchat,cgsimo,"Its just dumb bouncers thinking they are special. Even if age verification was not fool proof, which it probably isn't 100%, its still a lot more reliable than just asking. Like anyone can just lie. If someone doesn't recognize my age verification and insist on me giving my DOB I just leave the instance."
1j03tol,VRchat,Korteck,"Anyone who thinks asking someone their age is somehow more secure than someone submitting government ID and a facial scan is a moron and probably just wants to power trip. I've told my actual birthrate to these bouncers maybe twice ever. I've told them I was born in 1955, and no one bat an eye.Could some kid trick their parents to get verified? Yeah probably. Are the VAST majority of verified people actually 18 or over? Yes.Verification is 100% more reliable than just asking someone their age and hoping they're telling the truth."
1j03tol,VRchat,drksolrsing,"If you find people that are saying this, screen record them saying it, and send it to VRC.The only way to fully battle kids skirting the system is to blow their legs out from under them. The account will be banned and the ID will not be able to be used in VRC anymore.It's very easy.For the large number of people who have absolutely seen kids circumvent it, not a person has actual proof of this."
1j3bc4a,VRchat,Sitto78,While I agree this would be amazing for the game. They need to make it age verification available for everyone first
1j3bc4a,VRchat,RamJamR,True.  Whenever it's possible.
1j3bc4a,VRchat,littlegarden_spider,"i watched a 13 year old, trying to make the adults laugh i guess, switch into a practically naked egirl avatar with ""I <3 dick"" tattooed on the ass - i am BEGGING the vrchat team to bar kids from using these. it is so wildly uncomfortable and upsetting."
1j3bc4a,VRchat,Rough_Community_1439,"Sounds like the perfect target for my favorite line. ""I see you are using a meta quest headset, which has to be registered to a Facebook account. I can see what that account is and I am gonna send your mom a video of what your doing"" They 90% of the time freak out and get off the headset.Edit:thank you so much spider queen for the award. It's my first award!"
1j3bc4a,VRchat,ToriAndPancakes,Iirc there were plans to tie the content gate with the age verification system once it hits full release. That however would also require the uploader to properly tag everything
1j3bc4a,VRchat,Snowarc72,and if the uploader does notreport incorrect tags! its a report optionbam  working as they intend to eventuallly once age system gets linked to the content toggles
1j3bc4a,VRchat,LakesRed,Isn't that... the whole point of having the nsfw tags on avatars?   I thought it was always planned to make them invisible (robot or whatever) to non verified once the verification system was rolled out.  Maybe I misunderstood something.
1j3bc4a,VRchat,spark981,Sort of counter point in a way: this game should be 16+ at minimum. Young kids shouldn’t be on there in the first place
1j3bc4a,VRchat,zig131,"Platforms/Sites that are explicitly ""adult"" can scare off people looking for a SFW experience, and they can also have problems with payment providers.The few Payment processors that will support an ""adult"" site at all can have pretty arbitrary problems with particular kinks/fetishes, and they have the power of life and death over the platform/site.For example on FetLife, you arbitrarily cannot find any kind of Hypnotism kink through the search function.VRChat explicitly embracing, and officially allowing stuff that is currently against TOS, would be a massive change with huge ramifications.The status quo is /probably/ the best for everyone."
1j3bc4a,VRchat,CoxTH,"If you watch their developer updates, they are planning to integrate the avatar/world content tags with the Age Verification system eventually.But first Age Verification needs to be available to everyone."
1j9dt4z,VRchat,VenomousKitty96,Because people really think some kids gonna have their parent age verify for them and lie.But if a kid is going to go through that much effort to get verified whats gonna stop them from lieing about their age in the lobby too when asked.Mostly seems like an excuse to power trip.
1j9dt4z,VRchat,ScienceAndLogic-,FR every time i join a lobby that asks i say “I’m age verified look on my profile” they either get snarky or let me in
1j9dt4z,VRchat,AryaDRed,"People power triping and them not looking into the profile first, its not visible without.If some one asks i say im verrified and if they insist and power trip i leave, that conversation is not worth my oxigen"
1j9dt4z,VRchat,LigerXT5,"Same here. Wife (VRChat Mute and Desktop) and I visit a number of bar worlds, and we're asked and we state we're 18+ Verified, welcome to check our profile. Half the time, they don't and repeat the question. We shrug and leave.She's even gone as far as having her age and birth date in her Bio.What really annoys them, Sunset Bar, you can verify on their site, and just walk through the gates."
1j9dt4z,VRchat,allofdarknessin1,"So I went to an event tonight. Kind of newer player joined while I was waiting in security. They tell him he’s not verified in the server and even joined it. He said he’s age verified. They explain some kids got access to their parents id card and verified, so because of that they the guy has to join the server and verify with his id. He says he’s been buying beer for over a decade and tells them he’s not doing all of that now but will do it for next time. And left. I had to fight the urge to tell them a few kids getting verified isn’t enough and probably never happened and that this is all bullshit"
1j9dt4z,VRchat,Midnight_Myth,"""They explain some kids got access to their parents id card and verified""""the guy has to join the server and verify with his id""Always find that logic of those people funny. Some kid was able to get the id card and circumvent the system, where you have to make a biometric scan. This same person definitely won't be able to just bypass the ""check"" on the server the same way."
1j9dt4z,VRchat,TotallyUnInvisable,"it's because people think you can circumvent the verification so they do it just to be ""sure""or at least it's what I hear most of the times.sure it might be possible to circumvent the verification process or by using a parents account.but also in my eyes it's just stupid to ask when someone enters a 18+ instance where you need to be verified to begin with.to moderators of such 18+ verified instances in my opinion put in the rules of the group that if it's been detected you lied about your age or circumvented the verification process you will get banned from entering the group and instances associated with it,then you don't have to constantly ask it and it probably makes the time of the moderators also a more fun and easier time by hanging around the other people instead of constantly asking for age and dat of birth."
1j9dt4z,VRchat,smalldroplet,"Nah, they just power tripping. Move along."
1j9dt4z,VRchat,According-Stage-8665,I've stopped going to bar worlds and other ones cause of it. Some of them are so fucking cocky when they tell you they don't accept it to. Me being age verified is essentially the same thing but better cause at least you can trust it more. It's all dumb.
1j9dt4z,VRchat,yandeere-love,"That's strange and frustrating. Possible theories come to mind:They've been bitten by mishandling minors and now they're paranoid (unlikely, asking someone's DOB is weaker verification than VRC's new age verification processPotential grooming? Do you have a voice that sounds young-ish perchance?Power trip, some moderators let a tiny amount of power allow them to ffeel like gods"
1j9i7pq,VRchat,LizaraRagnaros,"I don't think the average user knows for certain. I'd ask VRC support or check their info page about age verification if there is something about it.as someone else already said ban will lock that ID, but idk if that is because your ID is permanently tied to the account or if that's just because you were banned.I would assume the ID is now permanently tied to the account, because otherwise people with 2 ""strikes"" on their account can just make a new one to reset the counter. for less severe offenses VRC bans twice (1 week, 1 month) before issuing the perma"
1j9i7pq,VRchat,bunnythistle,"That would be a question for VRChat support. However, their FAQ page does mention that if your account is banned and you later create a new account, they would be able to prevent you from age verifying a new account:Enforce bans: We can check if an ID was previously associated with a banned account, preventing banned users from verifying new accounts with the same ID.However they have also mentioned that in the future they are considering changing it so that you may be able to verify multiple accounts with the same ID:Enable multiple accounts: We can allow users to have more than one verified account using the same ID. Previously, this would have required keeping your full ID data with Persona. While this is not planned for initial launch, we are considering the feedback that you have given us.Source:https://ask.vrchat.com/t/age-verification-faq/28458Of course, it's rather unusual that you would need to delete and make a new account too. If you don't like your username in VRChat you can change it. If you're trying to avoid some people, just block them. If you're trying to get around a block or ban, don't do that."
1j9i7pq,VRchat,Andreasmeow,Cute bnnuy pfp uwu
1j9i7pq,VRchat,EstidEstiloso,"Good question. It's known that if you are permanently banned from a verified account, you will never be able to verify another account with the same ID.However, what happens if the user voluntarily deletes their verified account entirely, and then creates a new account in the future and tries to verify it with the same ID? Would that be possible?"
1j9i7pq,VRchat,LigerXT5,"If what I recall from the update posts is still current, it'd be best to do the following.Request your Verified ID to be removed, clearing your ID from the system. Then you can delete your account and start a new one and verify it."
1j9i7pq,VRchat,dailyflyer,It is my understanding that you can only age verify one account. If you delete it or lose it you are out of luck going forward.
1j9i7pq,VRchat,Todayitworksyaknow,Why delete the account?Remove all your friends and name change
1j9i7pq,VRchat,DanES104,does the note section persist if i remove them from my friendlist? for example they put a note in my account
1j9i7pq,VRchat,Shadowraiden,best to contact support here from what i know the ID is paired to the account permanently.
1jdvfbi,VRchat,BobLeMaladroit,Im not sure about the time it will take to be available to everyone but I know if you verify and then run out you are still verified and are able to join the 18+ instances.
1jdvfbi,VRchat,Bahamut1988,"I doubt it will be, since creating groups is also still VRC+ only, and they said that was also temporary"
1jdvfbi,VRchat,SocietyTomorrow,"From the company side, it costs anywhere from $8-15 to do an ID verification with the companies that do it. They're charging because they cant take a loss to verify ID. If the government came up with a free program to privately verify age (because they seem to want that for pron pretty bad) then I could see VRC doing it since it would be neutral for them."
1jdvfbi,VRchat,Docteh,"VRChat works slowly on things because anything they do, someone will panic about it. Just today I saw a bunch of people all worried that people putting stickers on things might be disparaging to vtubers, and that if they can't prevent stickers in worlds they'd have to take them down.  God forbid photoshop exist.I just checked age verification of all my friends, 21%. Last time I checked it was like 10% so its a going, but I know a lot of people who aren't in a hurry."
1jdvfbi,VRchat,Strawberry_Sheep,"They've said it's because it costs them money for every verification so they can't make it free. Similar platforms (second life, IMVU, etc) all paywall their age verifications for the same reason. Also because paywalling it adds another layer of verification since the subscription for VRC+ can't be paid for with steam wallet and has to have a credit/debit card attached to the steam account. Though VRC+ gifting is still possible"
1jdvfbi,VRchat,BUzer2017,"""since the subscription for VRC+ can't be paid for with steam wallet and has to have a credit/debit card attached to the steam account.""huh? It absolutely can be paid with a Steam wallet.I use Steam wallet to buy vrc+ and vbucks all the time."
1jdvfbi,VRchat,FemBoyGod,"I’m ngl I support age verification, it just makes sense for people who want to join 18+ only servers.Idk maybe I’m weird, but I’ll gladly pay the fee"
1jdvfbi,VRchat,FatedHero,They’ve never stated verification would always be locked behind vrc+. The select group phase was mostly just to test out world stability and the core functionality of it. Now with vrc+ it’s probably a big stress test and or data gathering at a much larger scale. I don’t see it staying locked behind a paywall forever nor do I think it’s caused a “major” uptick in vrc+ sales.
1jdvfbi,VRchat,Lycos_hayes,"We currently have a multi layered issue related to verification:-larger groups don't want to do age verified instances due to not all their members having verification, and by extension, ostracizing those who don't.-groups that use bouncers instruct their bouncers to not use verification status as a check due to misinformation about kids being able to bypass it.-we're still on phase 2 of the roll out of verification, with phase 3 being access to all, and we have no timetable on how long this phase will be."
1jf3h4f,VRchat,Sanquinity,"Wait, people still want all kinds of personal information for their ""18+ instances""? Fuck that...I'm age verified. If that's not good enough for you you don't actually want to check if I'm 18+, you just want power/control over me. I'm not dealing with that shit."
1jf3h4f,VRchat,Gallerian,"Yeah. And their excuse is always the same: ""Oh kids fake it so we still need to see your ID.""Despite the fact that faking an age verification is actually VERY hard to do. Even the most technologically inept parent would have second thoughts of having to have their ID pictures, then taking profile shots of yourself to make sure the face actually matches the ID.As you said. It's nothing more than a power trip for those guys."
1jf3h4f,VRchat,SadKat002,"I'm gonna have to find this group so I can join, I'm so tired of little kids being in CAH 😭😭😭"
1jf3h4f,VRchat,allofdarknessin1,Awesome. Same tbh. When kids are in the instance it prevents me from playing the cards I'd actually want to play. If you click the link you should be able to request joining. Let me know if it doesn't work.
1jf3h4f,VRchat,Ryu_Saki,"Considering that it heavily relies on the age verification I assume the ""age date and birth"" thing that bouncers like to do won't be a thing in this group?"
1jf3h4f,VRchat,allofdarknessin1,That’s correct. We will be relying solely on VRChats age verification and making age verified only instances. I want to make group public instances eventually to get the group out there but until then we won’t be using a bouncer or asking for any personal information just to get in. The goal of this group is to enjoy VRChat using the systems it has in place and create a frictionless experience as possible.
1jf3h4f,VRchat,Gallerian,"I also want in on this group. Frankly, it's not even the young kids that piss me off anymore. It's the goddamn teenagers.I swear, I've seen more immature 16 year olds than 10 year olds.But yeah, I'd love more instances where I can actually hang out with other adults."
1jf3h4f,VRchat,DJR3van,"Bro, I’m just frustrated that the Age Verification is not out for everyone yet. I will absolutely do it when it comes out, but I’m not paying for VRC+ just for this."
1jf3h4f,VRchat,allofdarknessin1,I intend to make age verified only instances that focus on Cards Against humanity and Black Cat at first and once I have some mods I can trust I want to host drinking/smoking worlds and dancing.
1jf3h4f,VRchat,aknockingmormon,A couple pics are posted in replies to this comment from relevant sections of the VRC FAQ. Just so everyone has the info.
1jhm6yx,VRchat,kwizyvr,"My answer to that is: ""Thanks, I'm good. Bye.""There are plenty of groups that don't act like this."
1jhm6yx,VRchat,Minxy57,This is the way; social darwinism will render them extinct in time.
1jhm6yx,VRchat,Sanquinity,"""But they could have taken their parents' ID!"" Do you even know what you're saying? That means a kid got their parent to not only give them their ID, but also take a selfie of themselves for verification! Do you know how hard that would be to actually do? And if a kid does manage to do that, that's on the parents at that point, for completely not paying attention to what their kid does at all. Besides, a proper age verification system is EXACTLY what everyone kept complaining about not being in the game. And now that we have it a large portion is like ""Nah, just their word is more reliable""? What?It's all just excuses to keep getting that power trip fix they want. I refuse to enter any instance where they still ask me for age and date of birth after seeing I'm verified."
1jhm6yx,VRchat,anthemlog,They won't believe the age verification but they will believe what ever lie you tell them. Just lazyness.
1jhm6yx,VRchat,Bahamut1988,"Agreed, these ""bouncers"" just don't want to relinquish that little bit of power they have, RP is one thing, but even there it's annoying and unnecessary"
1jhm6yx,VRchat,Chima_Lukas,"As a fomer bouncer, I like brother other bouncer who don't believe the verified 18+ thing"
1jhm6yx,VRchat,MarineSgtBlake,I'm seeing stuff like this pop up a lot more frequently. I don't give people the satisfaction if I'm going to be dealing with a power hungry bouncer.
1jhm6yx,VRchat,Thiccxen,It's always some geek with a voice changer on the door making them sound masc af too
1jhm6yx,VRchat,HydraSquid,"Agree. Though this exact thing is posted here almost daily, which I guess says more about how much of a problem this is"
1jhm6yx,VRchat,Pokabrows,I'm kinda at the point where I want lists of which groups do and which groups do not respect the age verification so I know where to go vs not go. It'd be useful if they put it in their group description/ rules so we could check without even entering the world.
1jif423,VRchat,[deleted],It's safe to assume that groups not making age-gated instances are not using the age-gated verification system. Instances that are age-gated are given priority at the top of your instance list.
1jif423,VRchat,LizaraRagnaros,"a lot are not using the age gated instances yet, because not everyone has the verification yet and they'd lose attendance. I've been to a few instances yesterday that want only adults there and they let me in after pointing out the tag. some even saw the tag and said that they see I'm 18+ verified"
1jif423,VRchat,Fair-Snow-6201,they will still ask by the sounds of it because apparently kids can slip through... which is bs imo
1jif423,VRchat,Chambers1041,"Basically just avoid any of those bar worlds that have security checkpoints, 90% I join just power trip it and refuse to look at the badge.Optimised FBT club I've had good success with so far, I don't go often but out of the last 3 times, 2 of them accepted my age verification (1 of which did so without me telling them to look!)"
1jif423,VRchat,Sansa_Culotte_,IME it depends not on the world but on the group that's hosting the instance.
1jif423,VRchat,Icy_Bed5219,I genuinely do not understand why all these groups still ask for that when you're already ID verified. HELL EVEN IN AN ID VERIFIED ONLY INSTANCE
1jif423,VRchat,GCAmazingBR,"There's still places that ask for that despite you being 18+ verified, but the quacking instance being restricted tho those who had verified prior as well!? Take my honest KEKW"
1jif423,VRchat,Recent-Comb9066,I hate that..... I agree I honestly just leave the server when people ask me that because it's just gotten to be too much
1jif423,VRchat,nick_the_fox,I propose a Automatic turnstile system where If players are verified then they can just walk through the turnstile.If not then They would just go up to a booth with a manual gate and verify with the bouncer traditionally.This would hopefully be a free prefab vrchat gives or if I can find help I would create it and post it for free.
1jif423,VRchat,maxsunshine0,I mean there's a few ones I've gone to that accepted the 18+ verification tag just gotta find em
1jme0ir,VRchat,metroidmen,"Yeah, I agree. It’s usually a power trip.With that said, if we REALLY want to think about it, tons of users record and/or stream their game. So when someone walks up and gives their literal date of birth with their username, who knows what doxxing rabbit hole that could lead to."
1jme0ir,VRchat,No-Reality-2744,"Yeah it was always a risk to wave your DOB around public instances. They aren't protecting people by asking this, if we claim to be an adult that is the same as hearing us say whatever year makes us 18 anyway. If they don't believe us claiming to be an adult why would they believe whatever date we slap in their faces? It's stupid and it's like talking to a wall to even try asking how it actually helps. The best they can say is ""we are just doing what we can"" when it isn't doing ""what you can"" when the doing does not actually result in a safer environment. They're just saying that to convince themselves they're not wrong."
1jme0ir,VRchat,FlexiCake,Exactly why I don't give out my DOB or age online. VRChat is just another online social media platform to me despite being a different style.I'm also a Vtuber so I gotta be careful to try and conceal my identity the best I can.
1jme0ir,VRchat,chunarii-chan,Most of the people that do this are underage themselves. As an adult I have no problem immediately identifying other adults. Adults don't do what they do. And I am not giving out my fucking information to random children on the internet when I could just be making it up anyway. Also I am 18+ verified. I can't remember the last time I saw an age gated instance except for the American eboy h party group who always have one
1jme0ir,VRchat,Helioskull,"It is EXCLUSIVELY a power trip now, the point has been driven home over and over, and it'll be driven home even more until the point is somehow managed to be driven to them. If you cannot trust a ID matched to selfie verification, you don't want verification, you just want the ability to stop people and make them do what YOU want."
1jme0ir,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,"Damn people you are so unlucky or I was so lucky? Had this situation only once.If you do an 18+ instance and want to gate keep it, then allow verified people in. So simple, yet too hard for some people with concrete instead of a brain."
1jme0ir,VRchat,pokemonfan95,Even age verified instances some still ask for dob even tho they use the age verified instance type and say we don't trust age verified system .... then why tf are u using verified 18+ only instance? They ofc try to make the excuse minors can lie on the 18+ verification . they can't spoof or cheat there way past it i swear the groups that do this are stupid power hungry idiots smh possibly there creeps running it who knows
1jme0ir,VRchat,drksolrsing,"They can't get much out of ""41, 83"".That's all I give them because fuck them, my birthday I'll be 42. The day doesn't matter."
1jme0ir,VRchat,LittleChi-,"There's people going as far as opening  ""21+"" instances yet where they give allowance to 18+ if they know people within the group or instance where I'm like ""that must be power tripping"" I couldn't explain it any other way"
1jme0ir,VRchat,mexicandiaper,Yeah as soon as they ask I nope out. I'm trying to relax after work not have a papers please situation from a 22-year-old in a fursona.
1jn475f,VRchat,plantgirl7,If anyone is asking for your date of birth beyond the verification and commenting on your voice at all they’re on a power trip and you probably don’t even want to participate in that instance
1jn475f,VRchat,weewoo0333,That makes sense as a lot of them would sit and argue with me which didn’t make sense cause if you really think I’m a child why would you argue?
1jn475f,VRchat,Just-Brush399,If they think voice verification is more secure than id verification then those groups probably aren’t worth your time. There’s plenty of groups out there specifically for age verified users. Try looking for the groups called “age gated” and “age verified”
1jn475f,VRchat,weewoo0333,Thank you! I had no idea about these groups and defo will check them out :)
1jn475f,VRchat,No-Reality-2744,"I don't trust the groups pretending a voiced DOB is more valid than ID verified as it means they will just trust anyone that claims to be an adult anyway. It doesn't help that I have found out that some groups do indeed ignore the ID verifying so they can let teens pretend to be adults in there. If they ask me for a DOB, it's an instant leave, and with the amount of other people doing the same they will just have to deal with the walkaways. Most nights I can find at least one place that takes my profile as a responsible claim of my age and knows that is already as safe as they are gonna get it, in-game at least."
1jn475f,VRchat,Kymerah_,"It’s enough to be age verified for normal people, don’t worry.You don’t want to be around people who still ask for your DOB, they’re doing you a favour."
1jn475f,VRchat,Aduritor,"It is enough. The only problem is that the powertripping group moderators had their precious ""age and date of birth"" taken from them, and now are spreading the lie that the age verification is easily bypassed (it is not) to keep feeling in power."
1jn475f,VRchat,Emotional_Fold_2527,call them creepy and find another world tbh
1jn475f,VRchat,zakku_88,"VRC player base: Implement some sort of age verification!VRC: *implements age verification* Alright, here you goVRC player base: No! Not like that!I swear, a lot of these people (bar group owners/staff in particular) don't want actual solutions, but just more of the illusion of having some sort of ""power"" over others smh..."
1jn475f,VRchat,CeriPie,Report them for attempting to solicit personal information. Asking for DoB to participate in an instance when you are age verified is a violation of the privacy section of VRChat's ToS. There should be absolutely no reason anyone should be trying to pry your DoB out of you if you are age verified through VRChat's official system.
1jpfvnr,VRchat,NIX-FLIX,"I once joined a public server and was immediately asked my age and DOB. I asked him if this was a group world, he said yes. So then I asked him why he didn't make it 18+. He froze for a second before kicking me."
1jpfvnr,VRchat,Appropriate_Ad5089,"Yup, sounds about right"
1jpfvnr,VRchat,drhurtzftw,its more annoying when your a medical mute and they kick you for not speaking
1jpfvnr,VRchat,Mr_SunnyBones,"The whole thing is pointless , anyone can just give a fake age and year of birth if they wanted. Even if a kid doesn't have a deep /older sounding voice they can fake it or use a voice changer . I've seen people getting mutes to type out the age and dob which is , well it's great they support mutes , but makes the whole thing even more pointless."
1jpfvnr,VRchat,-peas-,"I went to public Just B Club for the first time in like a year to test something this morning on US West servers because I noticed huge lag spikes with about 40 other people seeing the same thing. EVERY SINGLE ONE was locked and had eboys sitting at the front desk asking for age and date of birth. I stood there for like a minute in silence and they thought I was going to ""do something"" and threatened to kick me. It was one of the most cringe things I've seen in this game. They don't care about your VRC+ age verification either."
1jpfvnr,VRchat,Appropriate_Ad5089,"Yeahhh, I’ve been actively avoiding B club since the age verification update because of this. I hope you survived the cringe 🫡"
1jpfvnr,VRchat,Masked_Majora64,"Vrchat TOS 8.10. To make a long story short, they CAN NOT ask for age, date of birth, or any other form of Identification “On Platform”"
1jpfvnr,VRchat,TheRealWoldry1,"They're also allowed to kick you for any reason they deem worthy in a group instance they have perms in. TOS really doesn't matter when no one is actually breaking the rules, regardless of how stupid it may seem"
1jpfvnr,VRchat,Sorenchell,"I once joined an instance, got asked for age, and after telling em ""my account is verified, check my bio if you want"" got asked to leave, cuz this instance were for minors only. Maybe that's the case?"
1jpfvnr,VRchat,kwizyvr,I mean that's literally the only situation where that behavior would be sensible.
1js6dho,VRchat,EricFoofy01,Here is how it goes. You pay for VRC+ You go ahead and do the age verification process which is a few pictures and your ID After that it will take some time to process and you will have the option to show that on your profile.You DO NOT have to continue paying for VRC+ for it to stay on your profile
1js6dho,VRchat,Rough_Community_1439,"Can confirm, it can take from 20 minutes to three days to show up. Also I can also confirm that after letting the vrc+ expire you will still have the marker saying your verified."
1js6dho,VRchat,TheNastyNug,You can alternatively wait till it rolls out for everyone else for free but who knows when that will be
1js6dho,VRchat,zig131,"In the first stage, you could get verified by being in certain Groups.Each Group had a limited number of verifications available. There /might/ still be some left, but unlikely.Thought I'd mention as this explains why you might have heard of people without VRC+ getting verified."
1js6dho,VRchat,AshernStoryTime,Supposedly they'll roll out the verification system for non-members but for now the only way to do it is through vrc+
1js6dho,VRchat,AnimatedMania,Is their a goal to when they'll roll it out or is it a pipe dream kinda deal?
1js6dho,VRchat,oofx99,"yeah, it's functional at this point so I think they are just putting off letting everyone have it for free to milk money out of people to cover persona's costs that they have to pay them for."
1js6dho,VRchat,Embarrassed-Touch-62,"Yes, verification right now is only for people with VRC+ or those who were lucky to get it at beta testing. But once you veridy, badge stays with you, no need to continue paying for subscribtion.You will be taken to Persona's website for verification and be asked to show both sides of your ID (photos or scan). Also you will need to give a scan of your face."
1js6dho,VRchat,LeokingVR,when i did mines I payed for VRC+ verified my account went through immediately got on VRChat to see if it was there which it was and canceled VRC+ as you do not need to keep it to stay Verified 😌👌🏿
1js6dho,VRchat,[deleted],You pay for vrc+ then gave your id and then you can hangout with loser adults who think they are better than you

1jyor3p,VRchat,Dr_Vodka9987,"we are at a point in time where if i am asked my age i simply leave the instancei will not cater to those who want to feel in control, considering they already have said control if they're actually supposed to be thereedit- got a hate dm earlier for this so let me clarify: no i am not anti authority, please do not assume i am because i dislike being interrogated for joining a world i have spent frankly too many hours on"
1jyor3p,VRchat,VrchatBurner,This is the way. It’s not just a power trip. I feel like these groups have a handful of minors they like that they don’t want to exclude. Lock down the instances and remove the door security. Things would be so much better than letting in a new user in a meme avatar because they said they were 18.
1jyor3p,VRchat,TheShortViking,Vrchat or Persona cant really solve the issue that parents verify for their kids. We kinda just have to live with that it is not 100%. But I can promise you that it is a LOT better than just asking people their age. If a kid has gotten someone to verify for them then they will also lie when getting asked.
1jyor3p,VRchat,VrchatBurner,I don’t think this actually happens much. I think it’s a rumor spread by kids who know they’re about to get the age gate ban hammer. The last time someone asked me my birthdate and didn’t accept my verification … I looked around and someone asked me why I was pixelated. I realized everyone was on Quest alone and most seemed young and newer users. I’m giving a hard pass on groups that refuse to accept verification as I suspect they’re harboring minors. Most parents are not dumb enough to fully attach their identity to their kids behavior in a game that requires ID verification. It would be like loaning a kid your ID to buy booze.
1jyor3p,VRchat,FemBoyGod,What’s funny is I got age checked by someone who sounded underage.So I was gave a birth year like 17-1800s and was like I’m 225 years old. Just to mess with them and let them know like we find you annoying and we don’t respect your age checking.Plus I’m age verified so fuck all the way off
1jyor3p,VRchat,Sansa_Culotte_,Them not getting traffic is the system working as intended. Let's keep it working that way by not giving these clowns any traffic.
1jyor3p,VRchat,CeriPie,"Take the offensive and help us eliminate this problem.If you're age verified,report the ""bouncers""!They violate Section 13.2. which lays out prohibited conduct that violates the ToS, paragraph G, clause (III)attempting to collect personal information about another User or third party without consentThey also violate Section 8.10.If you create a world or instance, you may not collect or create features that collect information that provides the real identity, address, phone number, or government identification number of any User using such world or instance.It explicitly starts with ""real identity"". VRC resides in the US, and US law says that DoB is classified as PII.For anyone that's gonna try and pull the garbage ""you consent when you give them your age"" argument, it's only consenting if you WILLINGLY give it to them. If you say ""I'm not comfortable giving out my personal information"" or ""I'm already age verified"" and they persist by threatening you with a kick/ban if you do not give up your personal information, that is textbook coercion and is no longer considered consensual from a legal standpoint. Even if the threats are minor, the fact that they are being made at all, or even just implied, changes the whole situation.You always have the option to leave, of course, but it's very possible that the same thing will happen in the next instance as well, and you didn't join the instance just to turn around and leave because some pretend bouncers want to try and coerce personal information out of you. They are disrupting others' time in VRChat, which is also arguably against TOS, and breaking TOS with their blatant attempts to coerce personal information out of people.When asked to clarify about whether or not ""bouncers"" trying to gather birth dates is against TOS, Tupper said that he would not interpret the TOS for other people, but that if we feel they are breaking TOS he encourages us to report them! He would not encourage us to do so unless he felt that they SHOULD actually be reported, otherwise he would be encouraging a huge number of false reports!Take the fight to them andreport!! Let them know that their skeevy behavior will not be tolerated!"

v9uxmd,VRchat,MrUltraOnReddit,How?
v9uxmd,VRchat,PorkysRAGE,Me on VR with horrible controller drift:
v9uxmd,VRchat,Cat_With_Human_Ears,"Things to try:-Restart computer (as in click ""restart"", don't just turn it off. They are different processes)-Check for updates and make sure everything is up to date.-If you have mods installed, disable them and see if that fixes the issue. Then reenable them one at a time.-Open different programs and make sure it is not happening elsewhere too. You could have a stuck key or an input loop from a macro.-All else fails, uninstall and reinstall the game. If that doesn't work, the issue is outside VRChat itself.Report back what you try and if anything works to fix the issue. It will help others in the future."
v9uxmd,VRchat,vinkie2601,"I've restarted my pc, just restart, didn't turn my pc off and on again. No change.There were no updates.I've never used or even installed VRchat until yesterday (when it was also happening), so no mods are present. I don't own a VR headset either.It only happens in VRchat, and only in the menu, everything else works just fine. There was a brief moment that the bug wasn't present. It lasted for about a minute and I've been unable to recreate that moment.I already tried uninstalling and reinstalling it. No change.Validating files didn't do anything either."

zyjkfl,VRchat,bites,Furry Hideout's moderation tool is just like that.It is part of the world that certain authorized users can use.They've got the one flag that gets put above people's head when they're banned and it just says crasher.Either they were an actual crasher or a mod of the world decided to for another reason.
zyjkfl,VRchat,HubblePie,"It’d be kind of funny if that was his actual avatar, and the picture just hasn’t updated. No clue how that would show up otherwise, unless it’s a script in the actual map."
zyjkfl,VRchat,OfficerOtaku,"It's a script in the map I believe, not sure if it just detects problem users on the world's moderation list or just certain avatars that people use that have been flagged by the world though. I can ask some of the world moderators on this though to find out."
zyjkfl,VRchat,venturiq,I had their avatar disabled.
zyjkfl,VRchat,LunarstarPony,"It's a Moderation tool that exist in quite a lot of Furry WorldsIt doesn't really mean their Crashers but mostly means they got banned by a Moderator in that specific world for some reason. (Being Underage, Annoying People, Crashers, etc.) Ask Tau for this a long time ago.(From what I know I've seen it in both Furry Hideout and Furhub)"
zyjkfl,VRchat,_MyroP_,"I've seen avatars that can stick things on other avatars, actually one of my avatars can also do it (I can stick a sphere on a player's head)."
zyjkfl,VRchat,venturiq,Yeah I was thinking of that but I had all avatars disabled in that instance.
zyjkfl,VRchat,Helioskull,"That's what happens when someone who was banned tries rejoining, it will let them back into the instance but it will put that on them until they either change instance or the moderator of the world leaves the instance.It's technically against VRC TOS since when you ban them it sends them to a room they can't escape without leaving. I personally think that more worlds need it cause it actually gets people who are being jackwagons away so others can keep having fun.Edit: The tool is a script that runs on Udon, it's given to people the owner wants to have it so they can moderate the world. If someone is particularly annoying, the owner can write the person's name in the script as a blacklist so they are banned automatically on joining without a moderator being there."
zyjkfl,VRchat,HiyuMarten,"Furhub maker here - these tools are developed within VRChat’s TOS, and VRChat was consulted as part of the development process. It’s made clear to world creators who use this tool exactly what is and isn’t allowed by VRC’s TOS in the readme files & associated community."

1c8bvk0,walmart,Lefty68w,It’s the law and the easiest way to not break the law is simply request id from anyone buying anything age restricted
1c8bvk0,walmart,[deleted],"Besides the law and stores that have failed stings, it just becomes a habit. And where I live, when you ask, you HAVE to see the ID before making the sale. You can't change your mind, technically. On many occasions, I asked out of habit, realized the person was like 60, but had to insist on seeing the card. Dealing with age restricted items is not fun, and it's not a power trip, especially when stubbborn customers throw a fit over us just doing out jobs and trying not to lose them or even get into legal trouble"
1c8bvk0,walmart,WapaneseWeeaboo,"If you/any other customer appears under 40, the employee is to ask for an ID to verify the age. The only exception to this if that store has failed age check stings, and in those cases they’re required to IDeveryonethat’s buying anything age restricted, don’t matter if they look 100.Don’t like it? Shop elsewhere."
1c8bvk0,walmart,[deleted],"We have every right to ID anyone that we wish. If you don't have a valid ID, we can refuse the sale. Don't like it? Show your ID or fuck right the hell off. You are NOT entitled to special treatment."
1c8bvk0,walmart,Screaming_InternalIy,Always always always id. Doesnt matter if they look 20 or 80
1c8bvk0,walmart,Apart-Ad923,Walmart pays people to come into the store to see if we’re carding people if you fail you get a “red card” which means a coaching lol plz be careful with this
1c8bvk0,walmart,badeboy993,"Someone didn't do their job and Walmart must have gotten busted, so instead of educating their employee's, can't teach a turnip crap, they just set absurd alcohol ID policy. Well it just cost them $75.00 sale today. The lady said that if I were by myself she would not card me, but because my wife ""LOOKED"" under 40 to her (the cashier) and we were together, she insisted my wife show her ID. Well we don't carry our ID with us. I'm 63 my wife is 52. HEY WAL FART. how about you find some reasonable educated people to run your registers and you won't lose sales. I won't be going back to walfart to buy anything anymore for the simple fact that they are the stupidest, most ignorant company I have ever encountered with absurd ridiculous policies because they are unable to train their employees, but want to screw the consumer for their own short falls. BYE-BYE WALFART."
1c8bvk0,walmart,[deleted],Yes some of them definitely do it as a power trip .  There’s one self checkout clerk that “asks me” for id every time despite the fact I’m over 40 and work there and she knows it .  I say “asks me” because she just comes over and stands there and I have to ask her if she wanted to see my id .
1gps7xn,WatchExchangeBST,Thedarkknight1959,Nice!
1gps7xn,WatchExchangeBST,coreyz1103,Curious if this poses any risk to users selling used/new replica product if authorities decided to investigate?
1gps7xn,WatchExchangeBST,Altruistic-Jello-438,I went through the verification process and listed this sub as a community. However when I go to post I don’t see the goConfirm flair option…. How do I resolve this?

1goppd0,webhosting,thejohnmcduffie,I left GoDaddy years ago. They're horrible. And super shady.
1goppd0,webhosting,dbergere,Which TLD? Different TLDs have ID and nationality rules. I used to own a .ru domain (as in …gu.ru) but deleted it when their rules changed.
1goppd0,webhosting,jobcron,"ICANN requires that your data are correct as a registrant. You can still use a registrar proxy to obfuscate your public data, but the registrar has the right to check on the ID."
1goppd0,webhosting,cyb3rofficial,"You need ID for the WHOIS info for the domain name. Namecheap also had me use my ID after register a URL. the TLD for com doesn't require ID persay, just the WHOIS for it requires your ID. They need to make sure that some random person isn't going to try and abuse their services and that the info for the WHOIS matches up and not saying your live in the middle of the ocean."
1goppd0,webhosting,hunjanicsar,"It's the new security of every registrar for verification of adding a card, preventing fraud and hacking accounts. You can remove your card after purchasing services if you feel uncomfortable."
1goppd0,webhosting,shiftpgdn,"This is perfectly normal.  Did you use a VPN when ordering, or are you currently abroad?  There are a bunch of anti-fraud tools merchants use to identify potential fraud and you must have triggered one of the alarms."
1goppd0,webhosting,AndroTux,"Of all the reasons not to use GoDaddy (and there are definitely plenty), this isn’t one of them."
1goppd0,webhosting,nefarious_bumpps,"I absolutely support registrars requiringand verifyinggovernment ID to register a domain name, provided they keep that information private except to respond to a signed warrant.  It would give law enforcement the means to combat spam, scams and malicious websites.  Some ccTLD's have do have strict ID and residency verification requirements.I agree that this should have been donebeforecollecting your money.All I can suggest is checking if your TLD is the one requiring ID, and if not, demand that GoDaddy allow you to transfer to another registrar and refund your money."
1goppd0,webhosting,moistandwarm1,"This was probably triggered by anti fraud software. The money will not be captured until verification is done. I guess they have 7 days to do this. The money was just authorised, capture will take place once verification is done. If they don’t verify it will fall off in 7 days"
1goppd0,webhosting,Sencha-Skene,One of the many reasons I no longer use GoDaddy. Super shady. They kept causing problems on my e-commerce site just so they could sell me 'solutions' to problems they caused in the first place.
1iq1tth,Wetherspoons,Qwerty-03,"No, it's not a legal requirement it's something supermarkets do. Realistically a parent will be buying it for them as under 16s can't be in the pub unaccompanied."

1jlp0eo,whatsapp,Mex_1_Can,I had the same issue on a family member phone and I was just able to solve this.First thing I did was change the phone number but that didn't work. So after trial and error I just added a birth year of 2000 and it magically worked. It didn't ask for month or day. Not sure if you want to give that a try.

I first encountered this problem probably over a year ago, and I see posts on Reddit from 3-5 years ago describing the same problem.“What do local telecommunications companies have to do with your identity?”  You, my friend, appear to be unfamiliar with our modern cyberpunk dystopia.  I mean, I don’t know, but to verify your identity and age, you usually have to confirm via an email account or something that eventually connects to you as a person, who you really are.  It seems like in Korea they do that through a cellphone that 99.9% of people have.  I’ll attach an image of the “Pass” block website that somebody else posted from 3 years ago:"

I can log into my account, get stopped by two step verification, give my ID, AND STILL BE DENIED?! Everytime I called I customer support didn’t say “let’s see what options are eligible for you” no it’s straight to ID. And I don’t understand how I can give my ID and it still not work"
17003ae,yahoo,Yuurikd,ID verification is the only method ONLY IF its the same first and last. I had an email that accidentally had a different name tied to that email and I was denied getting help.They would tell you to call back every other day but it's only going to be the same process. I've called them 5 times in different days to see if there was anything else but it's just the same.

1gcmdr1,YouthRights,aroaceautistic,"iirc KOSA came from wanting to keep kids from seeing anything to do with transgender people.I think it’s because social media is an uncontrollable source of information. Kids on average are less indoctrination by standard american/western propaganda because they haven’t had as much time to absorb that information. Lawmakers are motivated to keep kids away from anti-american sentiment, anticapitalism, challenges to traditional gender, and other things that challenge them that kids sure won’t learn in school."

Had my first YouTube account at age 12 and my first Facebook account at age 13.Here I am.In 2024, I am alive and well.Nothing happened to me.This whole craze over social media is stupid. My guess is that we have too many control freaks and narcissists in society these days.Oh well. We have a narcissist vying for the presidency, Kamala Harris.

1g5z3bq,youtubedl,BuonaparteII,"I'm pretty sure I'm banned. Can't play videos if I'm signed in anywhere but if I switch to a private tab or use yt-dlp then I can watch the video. I think it's been longer than a month...Video unavailable
This content isn’t available.So far it's only affected my YouTube account but it's totally possible that I've been marked with the black spot just like Muppet Treasure Islandedit: it looks like I'm unbanned now. I guess it was about two monthsNow I know to choose vimeo for any heimlich maneuver videos"
1g5z3bq,youtubedl,grandinosour,"and creating a new account requires a legitimate phone number.Are you in the U.S.?Go to ""The Number Barn"" and buy a phone number for a couple bucks...you can leave the number in place and just have all calls to that number forwarded to your real number...texts will arrive to you via email...This is a legitimate phone number for cheap..."
1g5z3bq,youtubedl,mikefosh,"If you have the desire to self host something, you might want to check outTubeArchivist. It allows you to download entire channels or just individual videos, doesn’t require a sign in, and I have yet to have any issues with needing to confirm my age. I was even able to download a video that YouTube’s own website claimed to be unavailable. I was amazed to be honest. Lol."
1g5z3bq,youtubedl,IcarosFX,Have you tried downloading with cookies?
1g5z3bq,youtubedl,bashonly,"use a residential IP address (no VPN/proxy, no VPS/cloud etc) and download in moderation"
1hy1yeo,youtubedl,Johnni2004,"Hi, as mentioned in the guide, add the argument--cookies-from-browser “name of your browser” (e.g. chrome, opera, etc.)to the command line. However, while you are downloading the video, you should close your browser, otherwise the cookies cannot be read."
1hy1yeo,youtubedl,500xp1,Hi; suppose I opened cmd at the yt-dlp.exe directory; how would the whole command go (with the firefox cookies)?
nrcwbj,youtubedl,pukkandan,"youtube-dl has already patched it in code, they just haven't made a new release yet"
nrcwbj,youtubedl,Alemismun,Has there been a release since? I am gettingWARNING: unable to download video info webpage: HTTP Error 410: GoneERROR: Sign in to confirm your age
nrcwbj,youtubedl,rebane2001,"There are some workaround that come and go, but you should just sign in if you want it to work well"
nrcwbj,youtubedl,werid,"not always that easy, esp. if you are under 18, cause I believe google requires proof now if you're in europe."
nrcwbj,youtubedl,[deleted],N/A
onkqyy,youtubedl,pukkandan,"It is already implemented in youtube-dl, but there has been no release with this fix. You'll have to either compile it yourself or install the master with pip+git.You can also check out my forkyt-dlpwhere this fix is available in the release version"
onkqyy,youtubedl,maius-wthns,Cool thanks
onkqyy,youtubedl,WritingReadingReddit,"I switched over to yt-dlp specifically because of the age restricted video issue.Figuring out how to use a cookies file sounds too complicated.And, yeah, even worse is some countries requiring official identification just to see pictures naked girls.Fuck having to give anyone your real name for them to attach to a giant list of everything you've watched while masturbating.You might also consider a VPN so that YouTube and Google don't know you're in a country from which they demand identification.This annoying age and identity restriction is a perfect illustration of why we need this video ripping technology: The rules are always changing, and you never know why or when you won't be allowed to see your favorite video ever again."
onkqyy,youtubedl,q1525882,"Same from EU, Tampermoneky script in browser allows to watch them, but download is quite PITA at the moment. JDownloader2 also complains age. Not sure if my cookies will do the trick.Will try yt-dlp as few persons already mentioned this solution."
onkqyy,youtubedl,svnpenn,Another method is using OAuth. A Go package and command line tool are available here:https://github.com/89z/mech
1dh47f9,youtube,Osiris2408,"Bro, I’m 23 and I still don’t trust YouTube with that crap I’ve been looking for one but can’t find one"
1dh47f9,youtube,Jumpy-Violinist-6725,"yeah I do not trust any of these options. Granted Google probably has access to all this info already, but I am not giving them that stuff"
1dh47f9,youtube,[deleted],"I don't see that option, maybe you need to start a channel first before seeing it?"
1dh47f9,youtube,Jumpy-Violinist-6725,"I don't see that option, maybe you need to start a channel first before seeing it?"
1dh47f9,youtube,You_must_not_click,"That was for ""Advanced Features"". Watching age-restricted videos is not part of those advanced features."
1fhvv8h,youtube,migisaurio,Nope.
1fhvv8h,youtube,retrocheats,can you lie about your age?can you use a VPN?
1fhvv8h,youtube,-SurpriseMe,"A VPN doesn't work, and you can't lie because they require you to send photo id or credit card info."
