  "body": "I used to have an OH|ID account which at some point I set up 2 factor authentication for and I’ve lost the authentication key… so I can’t fully access my OHID account. I called the BMV for help, and they said I should create another account. The problem is, I can’t seem to verify my identity… it just says “there’s been an error”.\n\nHas anyone had similar issues and if so, how did you fix it? It doesn’t seem like there’s any real support for OH|ID. I just need to verify my identity but I can’t even answer the questionnaire. There’s no help desk number to call, and no real support options.\n\nAdvice appreciated, TIA.",
