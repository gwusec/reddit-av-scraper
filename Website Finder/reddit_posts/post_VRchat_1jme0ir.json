I'm sick of giving fake unverifiable birth dates to random power tripping losers who themselves sound like they're a few years from 18.\n\nIf you want to wack it to your NSFW avatar, don't do it in a public lobby for trash compactor or prison escape.",

      "body": "Yeah it was always a risk to wave your DOB around public instances. They aren't protecting people by asking this, if we claim to be an adult that is the same as hearing us say whatever year makes us 18 anyway. If they don't believe us claiming to be an adult why would they believe whatever date we slap in their faces? It's stupid and it's like talking to a wall to even try asking how it actually helps. The best they can say is \"we are just doing what we can\" when it isn't doing \"what you can\" when the doing does not actually result in a safer environment. They're just saying that to convince themselves they're not wrong."

And I am not giving out my fucking information to random children on the internet when I could just be making it up anyway. Also I am 18+ verified. I can't remember the last time I saw an age gated instance except for the American eboy h party group who always have one"

If you cannot trust a ID matched to selfie verification, you don't want verification, you just want the ability to stop people and make them do what YOU want."

They ofc try to make the excuse minors can lie on the 18+ verification . they can't spoof or cheat there way past it i swear the groups that do this are stupid power hungry idiots smh possibly there creeps running it who knows"
