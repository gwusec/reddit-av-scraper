  "body": "I don't know if there are many others who experienced the same problem, but I wasn't able to purchase LRC via Ramp anymore. The first time purchase via Ramp was without problems, however when I wanted to buy again they asked me to verify my identity. Unfortunately the ID verification process didn't work because \"my smartphone is not compatible\". Very annoying. So, what I did was the following:\n\nGo toloopring.ioand connect mobile wallet with loopring.io\n\nStart the LRC purchase via Ramp onloopring.iodesktop.\n\nRamp will tell you that you need to verify your ID but you can only do it on mobile. They will give you a QR code, email or SMS to send you a link which you can use to continue your verification. I used the email option, so I don't know if the other 2 options work equally well.\n\nOpen the link that you get from them via email and then you can finish the ID verification easily without problems on your smartphone.\n\nIt only took a few minutes for them to verify my ID and you will get a link in that email where you can finish your LRC purchase transaction.",
