      "body": "In the UK, not asking for DoB for alcohol, blades or vapes is an instant offboarding offence. Regardless of the age of the person you're delivering too. Asking for the DoB of a 95 year old is pretty silly, if you ask me, but most customers are used to it now.Funny story. When this was first brought in a few years ago, we had to ask for valid ID from everyone, not just the DoB. The AMOUNT of verbal abuse we got from people over 50...That fucking rule was in place for over a year."

      "body": "For the US amoung us, it's purely a UK thing. Not allowed to leave blades, alchohol or vape products with under 18's. But yeah, I've had AVDs that were cable ties (the woman I was delivering to was really abusive towards me about it) and also one that was a frying pan. The couple I delivered it to were confused, but they told me that it was for their teenage son. I told them that I probably needed to ask for ID, because food cooked by a teenager is a lethal weapon. They found it amusing.Also remember one that was a cheese cutting board. I mean, you'd have to try really god damn hard to stab someone with one of those. It'd be more lethal to leave it in the box and hit someone over the head with it.Edit: as an amusing side note, I ordered some *very* sharp whittling knives off Amazon and they weren't AVD, because the blades weren't quite long enough, I guess. Also, chainsaws can be left with under 18's. Go figure.It might be that the charging cable was for vapes. All vape products are age verified."

This one just threw me off a bit.Oddly enough, if you order lighters I don't think those are age verified either?"
