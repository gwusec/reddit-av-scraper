  "body": "It’s quite frustrating having many songs and documentaries I watched previously now locked off, and I use YouTube mainly in the app since my WIFI is too poor to load the browser most of the time. I’ve seen suggestions on websites and VPNs, but as mentioned beforehand my WIFI is poor, I also don’t feel like paying a subscription for anything simply so I can enjoy my entertainment or research in peace. Surely there’s a better way?",
