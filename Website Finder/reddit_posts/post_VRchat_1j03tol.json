  "body": "I was goofing off and went to Audience Anarchy and when I got there, three users asked me my age to make sure I was 18 and older. I verified my age and was allowed to stay, but when I asked if he could see my Age Verification badge he told me that he that said system had been compromised and little kids had found a way to cheat the system (which sounds genuinely nuts considering you need a pic of your drivers license along with an ai scan of your face)\n\nI decided to make this post to find out if The Age Verification process is still soundproof or if squeakers have found a way to cheat their way in.",

Or I guess they could pay another adult, but each ID is one time use.No system is 100% foolproof.However if the child was exposed to anything, that would be 100% on the parent and VRC would not be liable as they have done due diligance.But generally these people still asking for age without checking for the badge first are on an ego trip, and think they have some kind of super voice age detection powers."

      "body": "This right here.  Any group or club in vrchat declining to accept the vrchat proven age verification is actually putting the liability of allowing an underage person on themselves.  If a user is verified illegitimately they can also be banned and the ID will never be usable again (might be wrong on this but it's highly likely to be true).  Anyone either asking for age and DOB or asking you to join a discord and ID/ FACE verify instead of trusting the vrchat system (trust but verify, I've still ask just age) is simply believing they are a better judge of real/ fake IDs than any legitimate iD system."

I‚Äôd rather believe an ID system over someone just blurting an age they memorized to get in. (basically the equivalent of clicking ‚Äúyes I‚Äôm 18‚Äù on adult sites) are these systems fool-proof? No but it is so much better than what we had considering people begged for this to be in place."

I've told my actual birthrate to these bouncers maybe twice ever. I've told them I was born in 1955, and no one bat an eye.Could some kid trick their parents to get verified? Yeah probably. Are the VAST majority of verified people actually 18 or over? Yes.Verification is 100% more reliable than just asking someone their age and hoping they're telling the truth."

The account will be banned and the ID will not be able to be used in VRC anymore.It's very easy.For the large number of people who have absolutely seen kids circumvent it, not a person has actual proof of this."
