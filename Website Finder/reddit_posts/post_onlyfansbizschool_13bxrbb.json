  "body": "Let me guide you through the OnlyFans age verification process and ensure that you can continue to grow your business without any setbacks. Let's dive in and take a closer look at what you need to do.\n\nAs an adult content platform, OnlyFans has a responsibility to ensure that all users are over the age of 18. That's why age verification is so important. Not only does it help prevent minors from accessing explicit content, but it also helps protect the OnlyFans community from fraud and abuse. So, if you're a creator on OnlyFans, you need to make sure that you're complying with their age verification process.\n\nCLICK HERE - If you are new to OnlyFans download this beginners guide - How to Start OnlyFans Like a Pro- If you are new to OnlyFans you need this in your life.\n\nSo, how do you verify your age on OnlyFans? It's actually a pretty straightforward process, but let's take a closer look at each step.\n\nLog in to your OnlyFans account.\n\nClick on your profile picture in the top right corner of the screen.\n\nSelect \"Settings\" from the drop-down menu.\n\nClick on the \"Profile\" tab.\n\nScroll down to the \"Verification\" section and click on \"Verify Age.\"\n\nSelect your country of residence and enter your legal name and date of birth.\n\nUpload a photo of a government-issued ID that shows your name, date of birth, and photo. OnlyFans accepts passports, driver's licence, and national ID cards.\n\nSubmit a social media account greater than 1 month old with a minimum of 8 different pictures of you\n\nSubmit your information for review.\n\nThe first step is to submit your personal information. This includes your legal name, date of birth, and government-issued ID. OnlyFans accepts a variety of IDs, including passports, driver's licences, and national IDs.\n\nWhen you're submitting your personal information, make sure that all the details match what's on your ID. If there are any discrepancies, it could delay the verification process. Also, keep in mind that OnlyFans takes privacy and security seriously. Your personal information will be encrypted and kept confidential.\n\nOnce you've submitted your personal information, you'll need to wait for OnlyFans to verify your age. This can take up to 24 hours, so be patient. If your ID is accepted, you'll receive a confirmation email from OnlyFans letting you know that your account has been verified. If there are any issues, OnlyFans will let you know what steps you need to take to resolve the issue.\n\nOnce your age has been verified, you can start creating content on OnlyFans! Just remember to keep your account in compliance with OnlyFans' terms of service and age restriction policy. This means that you need to make sure that your content is legal and doesn't violate any laws or regulations.\n\nCLICK HERE - If you are new to OnlyFans download this beginners guide - How to Start OnlyFans Like a Pro\n\nIt's also important to note that OnlyFans has age limits for both creators and subscribers. Creators must be at least 18 years old, while subscribers must be at least 18 or the age of majority in their country, whichever is higher. So, make sure you're aware of these age limits and comply with them.\n\nOf course, no verification process is perfect, and you may run into some issues when verifying your age on OnlyFans. Here are some common problems and solutions:\n\nSolution: Make sure that you're submitting a government-issued ID that meets OnlyFans' requirements. If your ID isn't accepted, you can contact OnlyFans' support team for further assistance. They'll let you know what steps you need to take to get your ID accepted.\n\nSolution: Make sure that the social media account you provide as part of the verification process is set to public while you're waiting for OnlyFans to complete the process.\n\nWhen choosing a social media account to use for verification, it must be at least 30 days old and have a minimum of 10 clear pictures of you with your face visible. Don't forget to set a clear picture of your face as your avatar and banner too, as this will help with the verification process.\n\nSolution: Verification can take up to 24 hours, so be patient. If it's taking longer than that, you may want to contact OnlyFans' support team to inquire about the status of your verification.\n\nSolution: If you've been suspended for age verification issues, don't panic. Contact OnlyFans' support team and explain the situation. They'll let you know what steps you need to take to resolve the issue and get your account reinstated.\n\nIt's also important to familiarize yourself with OnlyFans' age restriction policy. OnlyFans strictly prohibits content featuring minors or promoting sexual activity with minors. Additionally, OnlyFans requires that all creators ensure that their content complies with local laws and regulations.\n\nFinally, it's worth noting that OnlyFans offers multiple age verification methods. In addition to the standard government ID verification, OnlyFans also offers third-party verification through Jumio and Veriff. These methods can be more convenient for creators who may not have a government-issued ID or who prefer not to share personal information.\n\nAge verification on OnlyFans is an important process that all creators need to go through. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can ensure that your account stays in compliance with OnlyFans' age restriction policy and continue to grow your business. Remember to always keep your content legal and in compliance with local laws and regulations, and don't hesitate to reach out to OnlyFans' support team if you run into any issues with age verification.

Unless I find a way to levitate my passport in front of me, they will have to put up with my fingertips covering the edges. 7th attempt failed. I have emailed support twice now. If they can't help, I'll give up.I totally get the reasoning behind how strict they must be, but I dunno, maybe they should get humans to verify instead of AI... A human wouldn't reject my application."
