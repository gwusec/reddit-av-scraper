  "body": "Age verification (AV) is a non-negotiable aspect of being a responsible and ethical findomme, femdomme, or sex worker. Whether you are a content creator, a dominatrix, or a findom practitioner, ensuring that all participants are of legal age is crucial. Findom, despite being centered on financial power exchange, is inherently a kink-based activity, making it essential to verify the age of everyone involved.\n\nLegal Protection:Engaging with a minor, even unknowingly, can result in severe legal consequences, including criminal charges and account bans.\n\nEthical Responsibility:As professionals, we have a duty to protect ourselves and the community by maintaining high standards of consent and legality.\n\nPrevention of Fraud and Exploitation:Age verification helps weed out potential scammers and individuals who may not be who they claim to be.\n\nWhile dommes understand the necessity of AV, many subs resist the process. The common reasons include:\n\nNot wanting to sign up for adult platforms solely for verification.\n\nFinding AV methods inconvenient or time-consuming.\n\nFear of exposure or privacy concerns.\n\nDespite these hurdles, it is imperative to stand firm. If a sub refuses to verify, they are not worth engaging with. Safety and legality come first.\n\nSeveral platforms and methods exist to streamline the age verification process:\n\nYOTIis a trusted AV app that allows for seamless verification. Here’s how it works:\n\nBoth parties download the YOTI app (free of charge).\n\nThe sub uploads an official ID (Driver’s License, Passport, etc.).\n\nA facial scan is conducted to match the ID.\n\nThe verified birthdate can be shared securely with the domme.\n\nOnce viewed, the information is not stored on the recipient’s end.\n\nYOTI ensures privacy as it only shares the necessary details, such as the age of the individual, without exposing personal data.\n\nSetting up an account on an adult platform is another effective way to verify age. These platforms require ID verification for account creation, ensuring that only individuals over 18 are allowed. Recommended platforms include:\n\nLoyalFans(easiest and fastest verification process)\n\nOnlyFans\n\nFansly\n\nPremium.Chat\n\nSubs should create a free account and provide their username as verification. This method ensures that they have undergone the same verification process required for content creators.\n\nCertain platforms incorporate age verification, via Yoti, as part of their services, making transactions safer:\n\nYouPay– A private, safe and secure gifting platform.\n\nWebscoop– A service for paid calls, digital product sales, and tips, with built-in verification measures.\n\nIf a sub refuses age verification, consider it a red flag and do not engage. The risks far outweigh any potential gain. Age verification is not just about legality; it is about maintaining the integrity, safety, and professionalism of the findom and broader SW community. By implementing these AV measures, dommes protect themselves and ensure a safer environment for all participants.\n\nStay safe, stay verified, and stay empowered.\n\nFor the FinDommes: A Curated Collection of Wisdom & Strategy",
